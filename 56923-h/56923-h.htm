<h4><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE">NOTE</a></h4>

<p>In writing on Turner one must necessarily make levies on the
works of other authors. I give hearty acknowledgment to Mr.
A. J. Finberg's <i>Inventory of the Drawings of the Turner Bequest</i>
(printed for His Majesty's Stationery Office), which he himself has
used with skill and accomplishment in his <i>Turner's Sketches and
Drawings</i> (Methuen &amp; Co.). Among the other books consulted
and quoted from are <i>Turner</i>, by Sir Walter Armstrong (Agnew
&amp; Sons); <i>Turner</i>, by W. L. Wyllie, A.R.A. (G. Bell &amp; Sons);
<i>The Turner Drawings</i>, by E. T. Cook (Pall Mall Press); <i>The
Engraved Work of Turner</i>, and <i>Turner's 'Liber Studiorum'</i>, by
W. G. Rawlinson; the delightful Extra Numbers of <i>The Studio</i>
on Turner, and the excellent little book by the late Cosmo
Monkhouse. Ruskin, of course, is frequently referred to and
quoted, also the inaccurate but indispensable Thornbury, whose
<i>Life of Turner</i> all succeeding writers on Turner have borrowed
from and upbraided.</p>

<h4>THE BOY AND GOLDEN ORVIETO</h4>


<p>There was a boy who grew up in the seventies of last century when
the name of Turner aroused no particular interest or emotion: he
was a classic, and he was treated with the incurious veneration that
is given to classics. Turner was among the gods, and if a descent
to the ground-floor of the National Gallery, where a selection of his
water-colours was shown, did startle the wayfarer into amazement
at the lyrical loveliness of those visions, compared with the sombre
and heavy magnificence of most of the oil pictures, well, they were
by Turner, and Turner being a classic, was not a subject for debate.
He was with the masters&mdash;fit and few&mdash;a classic.</p>

<p>I think no one dreamed of the extraordinary revival of interest
in Turner and increasing admiration for his genius that was to mark
the twentieth century, when the 'unfinished oils' were exhibited,
and later when the Turner Gallery at Millbank was opened.</p>

<p>The boy who grew up in the seventies, and to whom, in the first
idealism of youth, Turner seemed almost superhuman, has closely
followed the public manifestations of interest in the flame and
fame of Turner; and now that he is about to write a book on the
man of whom M. de la Sizeranne wrote:&mdash;'All the torches which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
have shed a flood of new light on Art, that of Delacroix in 1825,
those of the Impressionists in 1870, have in turn been lit at his
flame,'&mdash;he likes to return in memory to those days in the seventies
when Turner first became wonderful, something not quite to be
explained, in his life.</p>

<p>The boy was taken periodically, for education and pleasure, to
the National Gallery, and as he was led through the various rooms
astonishment passed into bewilderment. The mixed art of the
world was far too complex for the boy's unfolded mind. The clash
of personalities, the astonishing divergencies of the various schools
of painting confused and distracted him, and only when he
entered the Turner room (now dismantled), and was told, what
he had already dimly divined, that the pictures crowded on those
four walls were all by one man, did he find rest for his soul. He
did not appreciate all the Turners, but he grasped their coherency,
and realised what he was told, that they expressed the growth
of one mind groping from darkness to light. Yet it seemed
strange to the boy that he who painted the dark and material
'Calais Pier' should also have painted the gorgeous fairy tale
called 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus'; that the calm and contemplative
'Crossing the Brook' should have proceeded from the
same brain and hand that willed that wonder of wonders 'Rain,
Steam and Speed,' or the fading loveliness of the picture that was
then called the 'Approach to Venice.' The boy was not old enough
to understand the interest and importance of studying a painter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
work chronologically, which would have made it plain to him why
a man could paint the 'Calais Pier' at twenty-eight, 'Rain,
Steam and Speed,' at sixty-nine, and the sunlight dreams between
whiles, in moments of rapturous vision. These problems did not
trouble the boy. He was too young to analyse his impressions,
and they were all forgotten when he was shown the small picture
called 'View of Orvieto.' That remained to him all through
boyhood, and through manhood also, essential Turner, essential
Italy, a dream Italy, but more real than the reality.</p>

<p>Yet 'Orvieto' painted in Rome in 1829, and exhibited at the
Royal Academy in 1830, when the artist was fifty-five, is not one of
his great works. And it is not a view of Orvieto, that is, a correct
view. Turner was an interpreter of the soul of what he saw, not a
reporter of topographical, historical or architectural accuracy.
The golden valley bathed in sunlight, the city on the hill swooning
in golden mist, and the magical fading away of the uplands into
infinity, that is what the boy cared about. All that is pure
Turner, the idealist, the visionary, the lover of light and colour and
distances and the enchantments of nature. Turner too, but dual-natured
Turner, is the inept foreground, a mere contrivance to
throw the middle distance back; things pressed into his service
that happened to come to hand, the litter of properties, the 'drawing-master
tree,' the uncouth figures, the unsubstantial fountain.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Years later the boy visited Orvieto and found the city far less
beautiful than Turner's dream. But by that time he had learnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that the true artist is not a copyist of nature, that he states his
vision, the effect not the fact. This 'View of Orvieto' remained
enshrined in his heart. To him as a boy it was Italy, and Italy
never really meant anything else to his young intelligence, just
Turner's vision of Orvieto, a golden town on a golden hill under a
summer sky; a place where the sun always shines and where
there are little white roads leading he cared not whither, because
they all led to somewhere in Italy. This is the joy of the artist,
a joy that often he never hears of. This is his joy&mdash;to touch a
young heart to ecstasy, ay! even by a second-rate picture, and
to keep in that young heart a vision that the world and time can
never destroy, and that a visit to the place cannot dispel. To that
boy Turner's 'Orvieto' meant Italy: since he has become a man
he has wandered through Italy again and again from end to end,
but even now if he wishes to recall Italy, to be kindled by the
thought of that word meaning so much to Englishmen, he still
turns to Turner's picture. For him it cannot fade: it cannot
change.</p>

<h4>THE BOY WONDERS AT TURNER'S ART LIFE</h4>


<p>From 'Orvieto' as a starting-point, the boy, who is now a man, proceeded
in time to explore the art life of Turner, dwelling oftenest
on his golden visions, in which this persistent man, eloquent nowhere
but in his art, truly found himself. They were the goals of his
pilgrimage, but few appreciated them. Among the few was honest,
plain-spoken John Constable, who said of Turner's contributions
to the Royal Academy of 1828, which were so unlike his own practical
art: 'Turner has some golden visions, glorious and beautiful.
They are only visions, but still, they are art, and one could live and
die with such pictures.' Yet in that year the tale of Turner's
golden visions had hardly begun to be told. He was to go on
simplifying and simplifying, until modelling became subordinated
to colour, and the forms and shapes of things became lost in the
effulgence of light.</p>

<p>Was there ever such a life of industrious and progressive
work? It began when he was a mere boy, in the dark court
off Maiden Lane near the Strand; the long, laborious, loving
effort ended only with the end, that furtive, fugitive end when,
tired of man and his ways, the old, self-sufficient painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
disappeared from his haunts and his friends, and under the assumed
name of Mr. Booth, the sun his master, the river his companion,
met death in a little balconied house overlooking the Thames at
Chelsea.</p>

<p>Work, work, work&mdash;absorbing, concentrated work&mdash;that was
his life. This 'short, stout man with a red face and covetous
eyes,' was hardly what the world calls a fine character, although
there are on record many instances of his generosity and kindness,
he was as secretive about his work as about his life. The door of
his studio, whether in Queen Anne Street or on the hills was, metaphorically,
always locked.</p>

<p>When the boy, who loved the view of 'Orvieto' more than any
picture he had ever seen, began to study Turner's art life he amused
and confused himself by dividing it, as all his biographers have done,
into periods. These he simplified into two broad divisions, first
when this ever-ambitious painter pitted himself against his predecessors
and contemporaries, and later when, entirely disregarding
the works of man, he faced Nature, and challenged nothing less
than the source of all light and colour&mdash;the sun.</p>

<p>Turner's art life shows no sudden rush of genius. Step by step
he climbed, and had he died in 1802, at the age of twenty-seven,
when Girtin, his friend and fellow-student, died, we should have
had the record of a youth of great promise, but whose performances
were no more wonderful, if as wonderful, as Girtin's. From
the period of Training he passed to the period of Rivalry. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
many painters he strove to outsoar there was none so worthy his
challenge as Claude Lorrain, and to this day, in accordance with
a condition of Turner's will, two of his pictures hang in the National
Gallery side by side with two of Claude's, challenging the Lorrainer
from beyond the grave. The challenger has his desire, but Claude
is not conquered. The great Englishman does not dethrone the
great Frenchman on his own ground. Claude is unrivalled in the
balance of his classical pictures, and in their cool and temperate
colour. The real Turner, the Turner who challenged the sun, had
not yet found himself. In his periods of Power and Splendour,
between the ages, say, of forty-five and sixty-five, dominated by
such masterpieces as the 'Ulysses' and the 'Fighting Téméraire,'
Turner disregarded all other painters. And while he was producing
epics this prodigal artist was also throwing off lyrics&mdash;the
impulsive water-colours, and those 'unfinished oils,' destined, when
reclaimed and shown in 1906, to raise the art of Turner to the
empyrean of landscape art. They were works of pleasure, easy
evocations of his genius, done quickly and gladly, thrown aside,
never exhibited.</p>

<p>Of all the periods of his art life there is none to be compared
with the period contained in the few glorious years when he was
past sixty and drawing near to his seventieth year, the period when
light in all its manifestations obsessed him, when he produced the
'Norham Castle, Sunrise,' the 'Hastings' with the red sail, the later
'Venice' pictures, and the later water-colours, so delicate, so flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with sunshine that the world of sight seems to be swimming in
iridescent vapour. Finally, there is the period of decline, but what
a decline, that could evoke such a magnificent madness as 'Queen
Mab's Grotto,' and such tumbling splendours as the four classical
pictures he exhibited the year before he died!</p>

<p>The boy who loved 'Orvieto' despaired of ever being able to
write adequately about Turner, so enormous, so diversified, was his
achievement. Sometimes he thought he would like to consider
nothing but the 'Orvieto,' the 'Rain, Steam and Speed,' the 'Sunrise'
pictures and the 'Evening Star'; and among the water-colours
a certain dream of blue loveliness called 'Lucerne' and the
red 'Righi,' and perhaps the six small pictures, phantom ships and
fairy skies, that he bequeathed to Mrs. Booth, and perhaps the
four impressions in one frame, sensations they might be called, of
Petworth at evening, mere sunset visions, but such visions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">What was the nature of the man who controlled these
wonders? The boy read Thornbury's very interesting and very
unreliable <i>Life</i>, he read Monkhouse and others, and as he read
there rose before him a picture of the dual Turner, the great artist
and the crafty tradesman. A little sadly he set himself to understand
something of Turner the Man.</p>

<h4>THE BOY WONDERS AT TURNER THE DUMB POET</h4>


<p>In thinking over Turner the Man, whom Thornbury called the
Dumb Poet, again 'Orvieto' rose before the boy. The twin parts
of that picture, the earthly foreground and the heavenly distances,
continued to symbolise the dual parts of Turner's nature, as
indeed the natures of all of us.</p>

<p>The first book that the boy read about Turner was perhaps the
wisest and the most sympathetic of all his biographies, that by the
late Cosmo Monkhouse. On page 3 he found two quotations; one
astonished, the other shocked him. They neither astonish nor
shock him now because he is much older, and he knows that if one
passage is exaggerated so is the other. He knows that Turner was
neither saint nor sinner, but a queer-tempered man, with bursts of
humour and geniality, and a thirst for knowledge; a man of genius
with a dwarfed nature, uneducated, who in art moved easily among
great things, and who, try as he would, and he did try, could
hardly touch the hem of the garment of great things outside his
art; who loved his work before anything in the world, who was not
cultured, and whose manners were neither pretty nor engaging, who
cared nothing for social conventions, but who went his own rough
way, preferring Wapping and the sailors and the river, and rum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and brown sherry, to the conventional delights and the fine feeding
of Belgravia. Here are the two passages. The first is from
Ruskin's <i>Modern Painters</i>, published in 1843, magnificent rhetoric,
magical, and meaning very little:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Glorious in conception&mdash;unfathomable in knowledge&mdash;solitary
in power&mdash;with the elements waiting upon his will,
and the night and morning obedient to his call, sent as a
prophet of God to reveal to men the mysteries of the universe,
standing, like the great angel of the Apocalypse, clothed with
a cloud, and with a rainbow upon his head, and with the sun
and stars given into his hand.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second is from Thornbury's <i>Life of Turner</i>, published in
1862. There is no confirmation of Thornbury's suggestion that
Turner ever 'wallowed' at Wapping:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Towards the end of his career he would often, I am
assured on the best authority, paint hard all the week till
Saturday night; and he would then put by his work, slip
a five-pound note into his pocket, button it securely up there,
and set off to some low sailor's house in Wapping or Rotherhithe,
to wallow till Monday morning summoned him to
mope through another week.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The boy who was shocked at that extract from Thornbury's <i>Life</i>,
following so closely upon Ruskin's eulogy, found consolation in an
understanding passage written by Cosmo Monkhouse. It seemed
to explain Turner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'He lived in two worlds&mdash;one the pictorial sight-world,
in which he was a profound scholar and a poet, the other
the articulate, moral, social word-world, in which he was a
dunce and underbred. In the one he was great and happy,
in the other he was small and miserable; for what philosophy
he had was fatalist. The riddle of life was too hard for
his uncultivated intellect and starved heart to contemplate
with any hope; he was only at rest in his dreamland.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His dreamland served him to the end, to that day in 1851, when
the old war-man, warring always for the beautiful, having lost the
cunning of his hand, but not the vision of his eyes, died gazing on
the river, his old companion, whom he had loved always.</p>

<p>Gradually, the boy who grew up in the seventies, and who knew
golden 'Orvieto' by heart, began to form a mental picture of the
man Turner, gathered from the pictures and caricatures of him,
and the innumerable stories, some untrue, many exaggerated, that
have collected about the hairdresser's son who became the world's
greatest landscape painter.</p>

<p>His friend and patron, Mr. Fawkes of Farnley, made a
caricature of Turner which shows him as a little man, 'in an ill-cut
brown tail coat, striped waistcoat and enormous frilled shirt, the
feet and hands notably small, sketching on a small piece of paper,
held down almost level with his waist.' Yes, Turner was an odd
man, odd in looks, rough in manner. When he had passed middle
age the world meant very little to him. He cared for nobody: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
was hardly interested in Ruskin's magical extravagance of eulogy.
'My own admiration,' said Ruskin, 'was wild enthusiasm, but it
gave him no ray of pleasure. He loved me, but cared nothing for
what I said.' About the time that Ruskin was lecturing the world
for not admiring Turner, and lashing himself into ecstasy over his
idol, the idol was seen on board the old Margate steamer, studying
sky and water, and eating his lunch of shrimps out of a huge red
handkerchief laid across his knees.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner lived outside the world&mdash;in his dreamland. When the
buoyancy of youth had passed; when 'dad' was dead, he grew
more morose, more untidy and more exclusive, but his dream did
not change. No! it became more mystical, more subtle, more
unrealisable to his ageing eyes. Was he not in dreamland on that
Varnishing Day of the Royal Academy of 1846 when George
Parrott made a humorous sketch of him. There were four
varnishing days in those halcyon times, and it was Turner's habit
to send in his pictures merely laid in with white and grey, and to
finish them on the walls. We see him in Parrott's Varnishing Day
sketch at the age of seventy-one, a short, thick-set, clumsy figure,
with ruffled silk hat upon his head and gingham propped against a
chair&mdash;painting on a large picture, engrossed, oblivious of everything
happening around. 'I am told,' says Scarlett Davies, 'it
was good fun to see the great man whacking away with about fifty
stupid apes standing round him, peeping into his colour-box and
examining all his brushes and colours.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>


<p>He was in dreamland while the 'stupid apes' watched
him.</p>

<p>Did they hope to discover the dreamer's secret? Ah, gentlemen,
you did not find the secret in the colour-box. And the
dumb poet could never have told in words how he produced his
pictures, although when he sold one he was wont to say, 'I've lost
one of my children.'</p>

<p>The dumb poet!</p>

<p>There is a chapter in the second volume of Thornbury's <i>Life</i>
headed 'Turner's Poetry,' that seemed to the boy who loved
'Orvieto' to express absolutely, strangely, sadly, how illiterate and
inarticulate outside his art was Turner, and how eager to express
the emotions that moved dimly in his starved brain. Twelve
pages of his halting, imperfect verse are printed, scraps from the
longest fragments found among his papers after death, perhaps a
portion of that interminable, chaotic poem, <i>The Fallacies of Hope</i>,
extracts from which he used to append to his Academy pictures.
There is hardly a clause that is coherent, there is no continuous
thought, and some words are used in any sense. The impulse
to sing is there, but the dumb poet has not begun to understand
even the elements of the technique of composition. But the boy
dug out and remembered two broken lines, and they became almost
as much a part of his life as golden 'Orvieto.'</p>

<h4>THE BOY, HAVING BECOME A MAN, WONDERS AT THE
'INVENTORY' OF THE TURNER BEQUEST DRAWINGS</h4>


<p>Not until the <i>Inventory</i> was published was it possible to realise the
amount of spade work&mdash;loving, minute, unwearying&mdash;that Turner
did from the age of twelve to the age of seventy-one, spade work
that enabled him to will the golden visions of his maturity.</p>

<p>Everybody who has examined the Turner Bequest of water-colours,
and sketches in colour and in pencil, numbering over
nineteen thousand pieces of paper contained in three hundred
Sketch-Books, must agree that 'there is nothing like it anywhere
in the world'; and everybody must rejoice that, through the munificence
of the late Sir Joseph Duveen, there has now arisen as an
annexe to the Tate Gallery the long, long deferred Turner Gallery,
a tardy fulfilment of the Wizard's desire, one of the few dispositions,
besides his eagerness to found a home for decayed artists, that was
clear in his interminable and muddled will and codicils.</p>

<p>The story of the litigation over the will, and of the vicissitudes
of the bequest has been often told, and it will have to be told again
in its proper place in this book; how the pictures bequeathed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Turner to the nation were gradually selected for exhibition; how in
1857 the number had reached one hundred and five; how in that
year Ruskin began to sift and arrange the finished water-colours, the
pencil drawings, the colour sketches, and 'unfinished oils'; how he
chose what he considered the best of the water-colours for intermittent
exhibition; how he rolled up the 'unfinished oils '; how he
classified and commented upon the 'nineteen thousand pieces of
paper, worm-eaten, mouse-eaten, in various states of fragile decay,
drawn upon by Turner in one way or another, many on both sides';
how in 1906 the art world was astonished and delighted by the
exhibition at the Tate Gallery of the 'unfinished oils' by Turner,
reclaimed from the cellars at Trafalgar Square; and how in 1908
several other 'unfinished' works, described as experiments 'in oil
on thin veneer,' and a number of early water-colours and studies
were for the first time exposed.</p>

<p>By that time Mr. A. J. Finberg was nearing the end of his vast
work of cataloguing the Turner water-colours, and the 'nineteen
thousand pieces of paper,' belonging to the nation. The two
volumes known as the <i>Inventory</i> are the monument of his labour,
which has been thoroughly done, indeed, with an attention to detail
that wins the gratitude of all students. Wisely a strictly chronological
arrangement was determined upon. The difficulties
were immense, owing to the almost entire absence of reliable chronological
information as to Turner's movements. He was not the
kind of man to babble his plans, and Mr. Finberg admits that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of his judgments as to date and place are tentative; but we now
have a guide, trustworthy as extreme care could make it, to the
infinite variety of Turner's structural plans, his daily visions, his
notes of things seen and quickly recorded, upon which his life-work
was based.</p>

<p>The <i>Inventory</i> begins with 1787, when he was twelve; it proceeds,
year by year, to almost the end of his life, to 1846, when he
was seventy-one. Almost every summer, one might say every
summer, with painting materials, knapsack, and umbrella, he was
off on his travels through England, Scotland, Wales, or the Continent,
and, roughly speaking, to each year there is a sketch-book.
Perhaps general-utility book would be the better name, for Turner
drew and scribbled anything and everything on the leaves in his
almost unintelligible handwriting. Mixed up with his sketches, we
read how he got from place to place; of articles of clothing in use
and wanted; the numbers of bank-notes; elemental French and
German phrases; fragments of poetry, his own and others; extracts
from Sir Joshua's <i>Discourses</i>; a cure for the bite of a mad dog; a
recipe for surfeit; criticism of pictures, including Rembrandt's
'Mill,' Titian's 'Entombment,' and Rubens's 'Rainbow'; notes on
the colours of hills; the names of flowers; descriptions of skies;
fragments of letters, such as 'Give my love to Miss Wickham,' and
so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Such things are for the general, for anybody and everybody who
is interested in the commerce with daily life of a man of genius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
For the student of Turner's work, these details of his sketching
tours, chronologically arranged, are invaluable.</p>

<p>The boy who loved 'Orvieto,' and who is now a man, having
contracted to write a book on 'Turner's Golden Visions,' felt, with
this <i>Inventory</i> before him, wherein Turner himself tells in disjointed
fragments the autobiography of his working life, that the way to
write the book was to take the years in progression, to dwell on
each significant epoch and the work it produced, and thus to trace
the development of the dumb poet from darkness to light, from the
black 'Moonlight at Millbank,' to such an ethereal golden vision as
'Norham Castle at Sunrise.'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">He begins at the very beginning with the year 1775, when a son
was born to two humble people in a dark court off the Strand, whom
they christened Joseph Mallord William Turner.</p>

<h4>BIRTHPLACE AND PARENTS</h4>


<p>Few of the wayfarers who hurry along Maiden Lane from Covent
Garden to Bedford Street remember that in this busy, refurbished
street Turner was born. London has changed much since his
time, and Maiden Lane has changed also. Hand Court, opposite
the Cider Cellar, in which was the entrance to the barber's shop
kept by Turner's father, has long disappeared, and so has the modest
dwelling.</p>

<p>The house in which Turner was born, and where father, mother,
and son lived, is thus described by Ruskin:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Near the south-west corner of Covent Garden, a square
brick pit or well is formed by a close-set block of houses,
to the back windows of which it admits a few rays of light.
Access to the bottom of it is obtained out of Maiden Lane,
through a low archway and an iron gate; and if you stand
long enough under the archway to accustom your eyes to
the darkness, you may see, on the left hand, a narrow door,
which formerly gave access to a respectable barber's shop.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Thornbury has the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I remember the house well&mdash;I have been up and down
and all over it. The old barber's shop was on the ground
floor, entered by a little dark door on the left side of Hand
Court. The window was a long, low one; the stairs were
narrow, steep and winding; the rooms low, dark, and
small, but square and cosy, however dirty and confined
they may have been. Turner's bedroom, where he generally
painted, looked into the lane, and was commanded by the
opposite windows. The house where I suppose he afterwards
went to for more quiet and room, is at the end of
Hand Court, and is on a larger scale, with two windows in
front; but it must have been rather dark, though less
noisy than his father's house.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is said that the very early drawing by Turner, called
'Interior of a Kitchen,' in the possession of the nation, represents
the kitchen of the house in Maiden Lane, and that the old woman
crooning over the fire is Turner's mother; but this has been
doubted by that arch-doubter, Mr. A. J. Finberg. Mrs. Turner's
aspect is reported to have been masculine, not to say fierce; she is
said to have been a person of ungovernable temper, to have 'led
her husband a sad life,' to have been odd to the point of insanity.
Indeed she was quite insane at times, and maybe Turner derived
something of his genius from this ill-starred mother with the
unbalanced wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It is probable that the Mary Turner who was removed from
St. Paul's, Covent Garden, and admitted into Bethlehem Hospital
on December 27th, 1800, was Turner's mother. She was discharged
uncured in the following year.</p>

<p>'Dad' was sane and cheerful, a friend and companion to his
son, proud of his genius, and helpful to him. His name will often
appear in these pages. He is described by Henry Trimmer, vicar
of Heston, one of Turner's few intimate friends, as a chatty old
fellow who talked fast. We are also told that his cheerfulness was
greater than his son's, and that a smile was always on his face.
To this strangely assorted couple, a chirpy father and a crazy
mother, a son was born on the 23rd of April 1775, about one year
and eight months after their marriage. So Nature works, and the
good folk who would 'select' parents for their wholesomeness and
sanity may not be as successful in producing a genius as Nature
in her unpremeditated way. Joseph Mallord William Turner was
baptized at St. Paul's, Covent Garden, in the following month.</p>

<p>Ruskin has devoted a brilliant chapter to contrasting the
boyhoods of Turner and Giorgione. But is Turner to be pitied?
Art occurs, and perhaps there could not have been a more suitable
place for a great landscape painter to be born than in a dark
court off Maiden Lane by the Strand. For, being born in a dark
court, he had to seek the world of beauty, the wonder of undefiled
sunrises and sunsets, green fields and purple hills, pale streams
and opalescent lakes. He had to make an effort to find them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>At home there was at least mental excitement. His father's
customers were continually coming and going, curious men from
the outside world, who talked wittily and wore pretty clothes,
and gave to the watchful boy glimpses of the vivid world in which
they lived. And near by was the river, with its shipping, and
the ever-changing aspect of the tides, the old Thames, which he
loved all his life, and from which he derived inspiration and
consolation.</p>

<p class="center">1790: AGED FIFTEEN</p>

<h4>HE EXHIBITS AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY AND IS DESCRIBED
AS A LIGHT-HEARTED, MERRY CREATURE</h4>


<p>As Thomas Stothard was a customer of Turner's father, and as
many artists lived about Covent Garden, the boy's interest in art
must have been early aroused. It is said that at the age of nine
young Turner made a drawing of Margate Church, shortly before
he went to his first school at New Brentford.</p>

<p>An old schoolfellow tells how he drew cocks and hens on the walls,
and birds and flowers and trees from the schoolroom windows;
and there is a story, which has been learnedly revised by <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, of a sketch which he made of a coat-of-arms from a
drawing at Mr. Tomkison's the jeweller. At the age of thirteen
he is described as short and thick-set, with grey-blue eyes and
arched eyebrows, a handsome boy, careless of dress, but sturdy
and determined.</p>

<p>Turner's education was perfunctory; indeed, he had no real
education at all, but he acquired the rudiments at New Brentford
and in Mr. Coleman's school at Margate. We are told that he made
the journey 'in a hoy, a bluff-bowed cutter-rigged craft, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
long bowsprit and heavy main boom.' That voyage must have
been one of the events of his boyhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Palice, a floral drawing-master, also had the honour of
instructing him, and Mr. Thomas Malton, a perspective draughtsman.
Later he learnt something at Paul Sandby's Drawing
Academy in St. Martin's Lane, but more from Mr. Hardwick, the
architect, who employed him in adding landscape backgrounds to
plans, etc., and who introduced him, it is believed, to the schools
of the Royal Academy, where we find him enrolled as a student
in 1789. But all this was fugitive and not very important. His
real lifelong teacher was Nature, and he learnt how to express the
ways of Nature by first studying the works of his contemporaries
and predecessors.</p>

<p>He developed slowly. 'Folly Bridge and Bacon's Tower,'
which appears as the first item in the <i>Inventory</i>, under the year
1787, when he was twelve, is not an original drawing. Turner
showed little or none of the early facility of genius. For long years
he leaned on and learned from others. 'Folly Bridge' is merely
a copy of a steel engraving by J. Besire of a drawing
perhaps by E. Dayes. The colouring, says Mr. Finberg, is
probably the boy's own invention. It is signed and dated
W. Turner, 1787, and hangs to-day on a wall of the new Turner
Gallery at Millbank.</p>

<p>From an early age he made money. His father showed his
drawings and coloured prints in his shop-window, and sold them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
prices ranging from one to three shillings. The acquisition of
wealth remained one of the most persistent occupations of his life.
He was 'found out,' as Monkhouse says, almost in his childhood,
was paid for colouring prints and washing in the skies for architects&mdash;excellent
practice. The knowing boy knew it. When, in after
life, somebody expressed wonder that he should have worked
for half a crown a night, he retorted that nothing could
have been better practice. Sometimes he received as much
as a guinea. An old architect told Thornbury that he paid
him that sum in the shop in Maiden Lane for putting in a
background.</p>

<p>But the most important episode of Turner's boyhood was the
meeting with Girtin, at about twelve or thirteen years of age, in
the workshop of the famous engraver, John Raphael Smith&mdash;Thomas
Girtin, who was to have such an influence on his dawning
art, and whose personality was to be one of the happiest memories
of his life.</p>

<p>Turner's work up till about the age of fifteen has been summed
up thus: (1) Making drawings at home to sell; (2) Colouring
prints for John Raphael Smith; (3) Washing in backgrounds for
architects; (4) Sketching with Girtin.</p>

<p>Even in those early days Turner was secretive. Nobody was
allowed to see him draw, and he was as determined as he was
secretive. Thornbury tells the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Turner was busy one morning in the bedroom at Maiden
Lane, working at some drawings for one of Britton's
patrons&mdash;I think for the Earl of Essex. Suddenly the
door opens and Britton enters, nominally to inquire how
the drawings progressed, really to spy out all he could of
Turner's professional secrets. In an instant Turner covered
up his drawings, and ran to stop the crafty intruder's
entrance.</p>

<p>'"I've come to see the drawings for the Earl."</p>

<p>'"You shan't see 'em," said Turner.</p>

<p>'"Is that the answer I am to take back to his lord-ship?"</p>

<p>'"Yes; and mind the next time you come through the
shop, and not up the back way. I allow no one to come
here "; and so shutting the door on sly Britton, Turner
returned to growl at him over his work.'</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The <i>Inventory</i> shows that Turner was hard at work at this
early age. In Sketch-Book No. II., dated 1789, twenty-five leaves
are drawn on; No. III. contains five drawings, and includes his
'First View of Oxford,' signed and dated 1789. In Sketch-Book
No. IV. there is a pencil outline of 'Wanstead New Church,'
against the belfry of which he has written the word 'Ionic.' As
I have said, these Sketch-Books might also be called general-utility
books. Thus, in Sketch-Book No. V., containing drawings
probably made in the Royal Academy Schools, on the back of
a black-and-white chalk of the 'Belvedere Apollo' are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
notes, showing that his busy brain was already beginning
to consider etching, and that he was already indifferent to
spelling:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">1 Get an Etching Ground, 26.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">7 Re ... of Wax.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Turpentine Varnish and Lamp black.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>About this time Turner began to study oil painting, receiving
instruction from no less a person than Sir Joshua Reynolds. Little
did Sir Joshua think, when he laid down the brush in 1789, that
among the young men in his studio, and perhaps working on his
pictures under his superintendence, was a youth whose name was
to become as famous as the name of Reynolds.</p>

<p>We can tell exactly what degree of accomplishment Turner
had reached at the age of fifteen, as the first drawing he sent
to the Royal Academy, the year being 1790, the locality
Somerset House, a view of 'The Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth,'
is in a state of perfect preservation in the collection of
Mr. W. G. Rawlinson. He does not yet show any originality.
It is one of the tinted architectural drawings of the period, but
the work is conscientious, the drawing firm, and the reflected lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
on the houses well rendered. Here, too, are the Turner figures,
taller than life, a little grotesque, but accurate as regards the
costumes.</p>

<p>He must have been a merry, attractive boy when in congenial
company: he did not lack friends. There was Mr. Narraway,
whom he visited at Bristol, and the house of Mr. W. H. Wells, the
artist, was open to him, where he was a constant and welcome
inmate. Mrs. Wheeler has recorded the following charming
reminiscences of Turner at this period:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In early life my father's house was his second home,
a haven of rest from many domestic trials too sacred to
touch upon. Turner loved my father with a son's affection;
and to me he was as an elder brother. Many are
the times I have gone out sketching with him. I remember
his scrambling up a tree to obtain a better view, and then
he made a coloured sketch, I handing up his colours as
he wanted them.... Oh! what a different man would
Turner have been if all the good and kindly feelings of his
great mind had been called into action; but they lay
dormant, and were known to so very few. He was by
nature suspicious, and no tender hand had wiped away
early prejudices, the inevitable consequence of a defective
education. Of all the light-hearted merry creatures I ever
knew, Turner was the most so; and the laughter and fun
that abounded when he was an inmate of our cottage was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
inconceivable, particularly with the juvenile members of
the family.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a happy glimpse of Turner the boy, and with that I
leave his boyhood. He has just had a drawing exhibited at the
Royal Academy; he is advancing towards proficiency in water-colour,
his first and his last love; but not yet has he reached the
'golden simplicity' that Girtin realised, nor the 'silver sweetness'
of Cozens.</p>

<h4>THE DRAWINGS OF 'THE INGENIUS MR. TURNER' ARE STATED
BY A NEWSPAPER OF THE DAY TO BE 'TINCTURED
WITH TRUTH AND FIDELITY'</h4>


<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Five years have passed. Turner is now twenty. We will glance
back and see how he has fared. At about seventeen he attracted
the attention of Dr. Thomas Monro of Bushey, and Adelphi
Terrace, physician of Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, a well-known
lover of art, and patron of certain clever young men who
were to raise the coloured topographical drawing into the well-loved
art of British water-colour painting. 'Good Dr. Monro!'
The phrase has become historical. Turner was grateful to Dr.
Monro all his life, although there is no evidence of any great intimacy
between them. Years later he said to David Roberts:
'Girtin and I have often walked to Bushey and back to make drawings
for good Dr. Monro at half a crown apiece and a supper.'
Turner's affection and admiration for Girtin, that brilliant youth
who died young, lasted all his life. 'Had Tom Girtin lived I should
have starved,' he is reported to have said long afterwards; and
of one of Girtin's drawings he remarked, 'I never in my whole
life could make a drawing like that. I would many a time have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
given one of my little fingers to make such a one.' When quite
an old man he would mutter to himself about Tom's 'golden drawings.'
Thornbury says that he praised Girtin's 'White House'
with rapture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">Plate VI. Derwentwater, With the Falls of Lodore. Water colour (<i>about</i> 1797) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">At Dr. Monro's house Turner, Girtin, Varley, and other young
artists were set to copy drawings by Rembrandt, Canaletto, Gainsborough,
and other masters; also the drawings of John Cozens,
Turner's senior by twenty-three years, who had lately returned
from Italy and Switzerland. Cozens, that poet with the brush,
had a great influence upon him, but Turner's drawings of this
period have none of the repose, quiet beauty, and spacious feeling
of Cozens'. Perhaps the 'Pent House, Dover,' draws nearest to
the poetry of Cozens. Simple in treatment and colour, it shows
more imagination than the well-known 'Tintern Abbey' at the
Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>

<p>The 'Bristol and Malmesbury' Sketch-Book, dated 1791, has
twenty-three leaves, all drawn on; the 'Bristol' Sketch-Book of
the same year has seven; and in 1792 we find a drawing of the
'Burning of the Pantheon' in Oxford Street, a carefully worked
water-colour with a large number of figures. On the left are firemen
in their uniforms with hose and engines, and a crowd of
spectators and passers-by. A drawing of the 'Pantheon the Morning
after the Fire' was exhibited in the Academy of 1792. So,
at the age of seventeen, while intent now, as for years to come,
on the work of other painters, Turner had begun the direct study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of life, of vivid realities. In the 'Hereford and Worcester' Sketch-Book,
1792-93, there are 'Two Sketches near Malvern.' Beneath
the second, showing a roadway with foreground trees, the following
is inscribed in his own handwriting:&mdash;'The distance last with the
sky a lovely tint of Blue Lake and Indian&mdash;more as it approaches.'
He probably knew exactly what he meant. And no doubt the
following comment on the back of a water-colour of a 'Tree and
Tower' was all he needed to impress on his mind the effect of
what he had seen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In the shadow the Stones the same. Some Umber and
S. Green&mdash;the broken part umber and Bister, the distance
part a Blue Green Sap and B.'</p></blockquote>

<p>By the year 1795, when he was twenty years of age, Turner
was quite a successful young man. His drawings were hung at
the Royal Academy, he sold them readily, and he had been commissioned
by the <i>Copper Plate Magazine</i> to make a series of water-colours
for engraving at two guineas apiece. In one of the volumes
of that publication he is alluded to as 'The ingenius Mr. Turner.'
Moreover, the public press had begun to notice the work of 'the
ingenius Mr. Turner.' Here is a complimentary contemporary
criticism:&mdash;</p>

ability; the character of Gothic architecture is most
happily preserved, and its profusion of minute parts massed

<p>'Christchurch Gate' was one of five drawings he sent to the
Academy of 1794. In 1795, 'W. Turner, Hand Court, 26 Maiden
Lane, Covent Garden,' exhibited eight drawings.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above extracts from the <i>Inventory</i> how
early Turner became a traveller. He was a traveller almost to
the end of his life, and, whatever else he forgot, he never left his
sketch-book at home. 'No day without a note of Nature' might
almost have been his motto. His sketch-books are the guides to
his travels, and when I turn the pages and follow the wanderings
of this unresting man of genius, there rises before me, as a companion
to the sketch-books, the map that Mr. Huish compiled of
Turner's tours through Great Britain. The lines of his tracks
cover the map, those tracks along which he walked, or coached,
or rode, and in their appointed places are marked the sixty-six
castles, the twenty-seven abbeys, and the fourteen cathedrals
that he drew. Some day, when I have leisure, I think I will
make similar maps of his tours through France, Italy and Switzerland.
He would walk his twenty miles a day with his baggage
tied in a big handkerchief, his umbrella in his hand, and often his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fishing-rod. But the clearest vision of him I have is that day
in 1792, when, at the age of seventeen, he started off on his first
tour in Wales, on a pony lent him by his friend Mr. Narraway.
To be seventeen, to be conscious of great powers, all the wide
world and the wide future opening, and a good little pony as companion.
Has life anything better to offer than that?</p>

<p>In the 'South Wales' Sketch-Book of 1795, among the 'Order'd
Drawings,' a list of which he has inscribed on one of the pages, is
'Newport Castle&mdash;Mr. Kershaw.' No doubt this is the 'Newport'
now in the Salting Collection at the British Museum, one of the most
accomplished of his early drawings, pleasant in colour and bold
in mass.</p>

<h4>HIS FIRST OIL PICTURES AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS
SKETCH-BOOKS</h4>


<p>Five more years have passed. Turner has made his North of
England tour about which Ruskin wrote so eloquently&mdash;and so
unconvincingly. Cosmo Monkhouse, while reproving Ruskin for
the partial untruth of his beautiful prose, says of that 1797
journey:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The effect upon Turner of the fells and vales of Yorkshire
and Cumberland seems to have been much the same
as that of Scotland upon Landseer: it braced all his powers,
developed manhood of art, turned him from a toilsome
student into a triumphant master.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner was not yet a triumphant master. He had progressed
towards triumph in water-colour, shown in the spacious,
harmonious, and atmospheric rendering of 'Derwentwater, with
the Falls of Lodore,' and the very beautiful 'Study for a Picture
of Norham Castle'&mdash;rising golden rocks and rosy sky reflected
in the rosy water, one of two early drawings of this subject, displayed
in the new Turner Gallery, and reproduced in these pages:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
but oil was still beyond him. He had not mastered the difficulties
of that medium; he could do no better than the dark and
dispiriting 'Morning on the Coniston Fells, Cumberland,' and the
still darker 'Buttermere Lake,' that for years has been banished
to a provincial gallery. The young chief had advanced; he had
been elected an Associate of the Royal Academy; he had removed
from dingy Hand Court to decorous Harley Street; and he was
about to make the acquaintance of Mr. Walter Fawkes, the squire
of Farnley Hall, near Leeds, which was to mean so much to
him; but he was not yet a triumphant master. Only in his
water-colours has he begun to show glimmerings of his golden
visions. In oil he is studying detail rather than light; he is
pondering over masses looming in dim airless spaces; he has not
even yet begun to see the ethereal manifestations of his maturity.</p>

<p>No doubt he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy
in 1799 for the remarkable water-colours that he exhibited in that
and in the previous year, which included the powerful sunset-glowing
'Warkworth Castle' now at South Kensington; the
gloomy and magnificent 'Kirkstall Abbey' in the Soane Museum,
and the 'Norham Castle' with the golden rocks and the rosy sky
of dawn.</p>

<p>Norham Castle was Turner's mascot. He painted that picturesque
ruin again and again; it appears in the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>
and in <i>The Rivers of England</i> series, and 'Norham Castle' is
the subject of two of the 'unfinished oils,' disembodied spirits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
loveliness, that caused such a sensation when they were exhibited
at the Tate Gallery in 1906.</p>

<p>In later life, when Turner was travelling with Cadell, the
Edinburgh bookseller, making sketches for <i>Provincial Antiquities</i>,
the artist suddenly raised his hat to the ruins and made them a
low bow.</p>

<p>'What are you up to now? ' asked Cadell.</p>

<p>'Oh,' was Turner's reply, 'I made a drawing of Norham Castle
several years since. It took, and from that day to this I have
had as much to do as my hands could execute.'</p>

<p>Perhaps the interest of this period for students are certain
early oil paintings, showing the germs, so meagre of promise, from
which his magnificent life-work arose. The small 'Moonlight, a
study at Millbank,' exhibited in 1797, is now so dark that the
picture seems to be encompassed in a perpetual fog, dominated
by a round wafery, whitey-yellow moon; the sprawling 'Morning
on the Coniston Fells' of 1798; the 'Caernarvon Castle' of 1800,
silhouetted against a cloudy sky, so small and unimposing, that,
remembering what Turner became, one has for it a sentimental
affection; and the dark, disappearing 'Dolbadern Castle' that
hangs in the Diploma Gallery in Burlington House. It was
exhibited in 1800; but as Turner was not elected a full Royal
Academician until 1802, this can hardly be his Diploma picture.
The 'Tenth Plague of Egypt,' exhibited in 1802, has been honoured
by a place on the line in the new Turner Gallery at Millbank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Green, of Ipswich, is known to fame&mdash;or perhaps I
should say to the present writer&mdash;for the inscription in his diary
of the following brief criticism of Turner's oil picture, exhibited
in the Royal Academy of 1797, called 'Fishermen Coming Ashore
at Sunset, Previous to a Gale ':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>'June 2nd,</i>1797.&mdash;Visited the Royal Academy Exhibition.
Particularly struck with a sea-view by Turner;
fishing-vessels coming in, with a heavy swell, in apprehension
of tempest gathering in the distance, and casting, as it
advances, a night of shade, while a parting glow is spread
with fine effect upon the shore. The whole composition
bold in design and masterly in execution. I am entirely
unacquainted with the artist; but if he proceeds as he has
begun, he cannot fail to become the first in his department.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Dayes, an architectural draughtsman, the master of Girtin,
said of Turner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The way he acquired his professional powers was by
borrowing where he could a drawing or picture to copy
from, or by making a sketch of any one in the exhibition
early in the morning and finishing it at home.'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Another contemporary remarked of Turner, 'He must be loved
for his works, for his person is not striking or his conversation
brilliant '; a third described him as 'eccentric, but kind and
amusing.' Blake, who was one of his pupils, complained of being
left quite alone, and Thornbury states that he was too reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and tongue-tied to be able to teach what he knew, even if he
wished to disclose his hard-earned secrets. Turner never disclosed
any of his secrets. What he knew he kept.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">The <i>Inventory</i> from 1795 to 1800 fills nearly eighty pages of
minute records of his sketching tours. On one of the leaves of
the 'South Wales' Sketch-Book, dated 1795, I find this, but,
with the exception of the words 'Walls x White Lyon Inn,' not
in his own handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'To Tenby, 20 miles. Walls x White Lyon Inn.

and Laugharn (Larn as it is called). Llanstephen Castle
stands at the entrance of the River Towy. At Tenby
view the cliffs, caverns, rocks, islands, etc., etc.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The 'Studies near Brighton' Sketch-Book (1796) contains a
drawing of pigs and a donkey with this note by Ruskin:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Both wonderful, quite beyond telling. There is an
etching of Rembrandt's which approaches the upper study,
but by no means equals it. Examine it for a quarter of
an hour through a magnifying-glass, and you will see something
of what it is.'</p></blockquote>

<p>When Ruskin praised, he&mdash;praised.</p>

<p>In another Sketch-Book of this period there is a copy by
Turner of Wilson's 'Landscape with Figures'; and in 1797 we
find a book full of Wilson copies, and labelled on the back by
Turner himself, 'Studies for Pictures. Copies of Wilson.' In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the 'Swans' Sketch-Book (1798) Turner has noted on the inside
cover in ink a</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Receipt for making an Efficable (?) ointment for

<p>The details of the recipe are confusedly given. On the flyleaf are
several scraps of verse, probably his own. One of them runs:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Tell me Babbling Echo why,<br />

When I of slighted love complain<br />

</p>

<p>On the back of a drawing of 'Somerset House' (?) is this (I
copy the words just as he wrote them):&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Later, in the 'Dolbadern' Sketch-Book, he has copied out a
list of French pronouns and their translations. There is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
pathetic in these attempts of Turner to make up for his lack of
education.</p>

<p>The 'Babbling Echo' poem suggests that there may be truth in
the early love-story of which some of his biographers make much.
That may or may not have soured him; it may or may not have
been the reason why he remained a bachelor. I do not think
that Turner ever thought seriously about matrimony. His art
was his mistress, and to his art to his dying day he was loyal, to
the sacrifice of everything else. And he was loyal in his way&mdash;or
shall I say faithful in his way&mdash;to Hannah Danby, who entered
his service in 1800 or 1801, a girl of sixteen; who was housekeeper
in Queen Anne Street through his long life; and who, in the end,
when he had done all his great work, found him dying in hiding
as Mr. Booth, 'husband' of Mrs. Booth, in the little house at
Chelsea overlooking the river.</p>

<h4>HE EXHIBITS GRANDILOQUENT 'JASON' AND A SIMPLE
'VIEW ON CLAPHAM COMMON'</h4>


<p>Sometimes in early life Turner, one might say almost by chance,
prefigures the golden visions of his maturity, as in 'Conway Castle,'
in the possession of the Duke of Westminster, which dates
from about this time. The foreground is awkward, and strewn
with meaningless litter; but the castle stands up magnificently
against the blue sky, darkening to orange at the horizon, and over
all is a ripe golden glow. You see this picture across the gallery,
as at the Japan-British exhibition, where it was shown. It calls:
you are held by the dawning magnificence of Turner at twenty-seven;
you realise that the magician has begun to work his spell.</p>

<p>The sketch-books of 1801 and 1802 are numerous and varied,
showing his travels at home and abroad: the itinerary of his first
tour on the Continent; the 'Calais Pier' Sketch-Book, with such
drawings as 'Group of Figures on Pier watching Fishing-Boats
at Sea,' one of the many studies he made for his great picture of
'Calais Pier'; and the curious and interesting 'Studies in the
Louvre' Sketch-Book, in which we find this indefatigable young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
man of twenty-seven not only sitting at the feet of, but metaphorically
throwing himself into the arms of, the Old Masters.
He makes copies of many pictures, such as Titian's 'Entombment,'
'Mars and Venus' by Domenichino, Rembrandt's 'Good Samaritan,'
and to some of the copies he appends long descriptive criticisms
that often elude our efforts to find their meaning.</p>

<p>His comment on 'The Deluge' by Nicholas Poussin begins:&mdash;'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The colour of this picture impresses the subject more
than the incidents, which are by no means fortunate either
to place, position, or colour, as they are separate spots untoned
by the ... (? dark) colour that pervades the whole.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is his confused criticism of Rubens's 'Landscape with a
Rainbow':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The Rainbow appears to me the most to be considered
as a picture, not but this as well as the rest of his landscapes
is defective as light and the ... (? profusion) of nature.
The woman in blue strikes the eye and prevents it straying
to the confused and ill-judged lines, but as to the figure
(? figures) in Mid, which is light ... (? lit from) the
opposite side, a proof that he wanted light on that side and
either chose to commit an error than continue the light
by means of the ground or (? to) where the sky is placed.
Then it is lead by the yellow within the trees to the sky
and thence to the Bow, which is hard and horny by the
use of the vivid Blue in the distance, which is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
instance of his distorting what he was ignorant of&mdash;natural
effect.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the pictures Turner exhibited this year are 'Jason in
Search of the Golden Fleece,' the earliest of his dragon pictures,
that sometimes seem rather grand, but usually merely grandiloquent.
It was probably inspired by Salvator Rosa. Turner referred
to 'Jason' in later years as 'an old favourite with some,' and
Ruskin thought 'Jason' showed 'high imaginative faculty.' How
Ruskin studied Turner! Listen to this from <i>Modern Painters&mdash;</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In very sunny days a keen-eyed spectator may discern,
even where the picture hangs now, something in the middle
of it like the arch of an ill-built drain. This is a coil of the
dragon beginning to unroll himself.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'Jason' is now well shown at the new Turner Gallery, but I,
for one, infinitely prefer the bold study for this composition,
hanging in an adjoining room. Sketch-Book LXI. is called the
'Jason' Sketch-Book.</p>

<p>To this period of his bolder experiments in oil belong such
breezy works as 'Dutch Boats in a Gale' at Bridgewater House,
and 'Fishing Boats in a Stiff Breeze,' both done in emulation of
Van de Velde. Turner said that seeing a fine Van de Velde in
a shop-window had made him a sea-painter.</p>

<p>In a letter from Andrew Caldwell to Bishop Percy, dated
14th June 1802, Turner is spoken of 'as beating Loutherbourg
and every other artist all to nothing.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not difficult for Turner to beat Van de Velde
and de Loutherbourg all to nothing. We think so now,
they thought so then, if Andrew Caldwell expressed the general
opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'A new artist has started up&mdash;one Turner. He had
before exhibited stained drawings, but now paints landscapes
in oil, beats Loutherbourg and every other artist
all to nothing. A painter of my acquaintance and a good
judge declares his painting is magic; that it is worth
every landscape painter's while to make a pilgrimage to see
and study his works. Loutherbourg, he used to think of
so highly, appears now mediocre.'</p></blockquote>

<p>But even in those days of rivalry with the so-called classical
painters, Turner was already beginning to see for himself,
and to express what his eyes saw. The 'View on Clapham
Common,' probably painted in 1802, merely a study of
sward and trees with men angling, is personal and all himself,
although Ruskin thought that 'the somewhat affected rolling
and loading of the colour in the sky is founded altogether on
Morland.'</p>

<p>To me it is like a brief personal and sincere utterance at a
political meeting where the speakers are all trying to say the
effective thing in the effective manner. Even such a doughty
critic as Meier Graefe recognises in this simple little picture a
'sincere surrender to the object.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Tate Gallery we may see Turner, painted by himself,
in the year that he took that walk on Clapham Common, a watchful,
introspective face as of a soul trying to see through the veil,
the eyes estimating and observant, the lips betokening something
sensual, the other part of Turner.</p>

<p class="center">1803: AGED TWENTY-EIGHT</p>

<h4>THE YEAR OF 'CALAIS PIER'</h4>


<p>Of the pictures Turner sent to the Royal Academy of 1803, including
a 'Holy Family' (he tried everything in turn), one work
dominates the group&mdash;the great, dark, studio-made 'Calais Pier,'
which Turner, never afraid of a long title, called 'Calais Pier with
French Poissards preparing for Sea, an English Packet arriving.'
Neither Turner nor anybody else ever saw such a scene in Nature,
and one wonders what Turner thought of this ambition of his
youth years later when he painted the pearly visions of the
'Yachting' and 'Whalers' series, or such an attempt to express
the marriage of light and water as 'Sunrise with a Sea Monster.'</p>

<p>He painted 'Calais Pier' in his dark studio, with half his brain
mumbling instructions to the other half as to how Van de Velde
and the other brothers of the sea would have done it. He made
the sketches from Nature as we have seen; but he had not yet
arrived at the degree of knowledge enabling him to paint a picture
without losing the impulse of the sketch. But Turner had to
build his foundations: he knew that. He could never have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
painted 'A Ship Aground' in 1830, unless he had painted 'Calais
Pier' in 1803. We may see from the 'Calais Pier' Sketch-Book
how minutely he acquainted himself with such scenes in Nature.
On leaf 58 is the following eloquent line in his own handwriting:&mdash;'
Our landing at Calais. Nearly swampt.'</p>

<p>Ruskin refers to 'Calais Pier 'as' the first picture which bears
the sign manual and the sign mental of Turner's colossal power.'
He also observes, quite rightly, that nobody is frightened and there
is no danger. And a child can see that it is untrue. Turner was
never much concerned with what we call 'truth.' The effect
was his aim, not the fact. The sky, except for the peep of blue,
is black, the whole picture is dark almost to blackness, but Ruskin
sees the first indication of colour, 'properly so called,' in the fish,
and tells the following story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The engraver of one of his most important marine
pictures told me, not long ago, that one day Turner came
into his room to examine the progress of the plate, not
having seen his own picture for several months. It was
one of his dark, early pictures, but in the foreground was a
little piece of luxury, a pearly fish wrought into lines like
those of an opal. He stood before the picture for some
moments; then laughed, and pointed joyously to the fish,
"They say that Turner can't colour!" and turned away.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The casual wayfarer through the Turner Gallery sees only the
absurdities of 'Calais Pier,' sniggers, perhaps, at the old fisherman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in the boat who is shaking his half-filled bottle of brandy towards
the woman on the pier, the lady having kept the rest for herself.
But the artist who stands before 'Calais Pier' knows what knowledge
and force there is in this dark sea picture of Turner's youth.</p>

<p>Such modern sea painters as Moore, Olsson, and the Frenchman,
Matisse, have, in the beauty and truth of their realism,
spoilt us for the old sea pictures. But they contained something
that we have lost. Mr. W. L. Wyllie, A.R.A., in his book on Turner,
says some fine and good things about 'Calais Pier.' After remarking
that in 'Calais Pier' the light and shade is just that of
Turner's studio in Harley Street; that the inky clouds throw
black shadows just as a table or a sofa would in a room; that the
pale blue sky is not reflected anywhere, either in the tumbling
water or on the tarry sides of the fishing-boats, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'And yet when we are back among the conventional
black old pictures, such as 'The Shipwreck,' the 'Spithead,'
or even the impossible, gloomy 'Garden of the Hesperides,'
we feel that, after all, the old Wizard was a worker of
wonders, and that he in his dark London room, with little
more than black, brown, and grey, could move us to awe,
terror, or wonder by the thousand-and-one secrets which
he had at his fingers' ends; but which we moderns in the
struggle to be realistic may perhaps have forgotten, or
even, it may be, have never tried to learn.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'Calais Pier,' says Thornbury, was the cause 'of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
most painful things 'that ever happened to any of Turner's engravers.
Lupton undertook to make a mezzotint of it, but he could
not satisfy the artist.' This is not the proportion of my picture,'
said Turner, 'there is some mistake here. These are perfect dolls'
boats,' and so on. After much loss of time and innumerable corrections,
it was left unfinished. Ruskin says that Turner got tired
of his own composition; doubled the height of the sails, pushed
some of the boats further apart, and some nearer together; introduced
half a dozen more; and at last brought the whole thing
into irreparable confusion&mdash;in which it was left.</p>

<p>We shall never know to what degree Turner's pictures have
blackened. Burnet says that when the 'Festival upon the Opening
of the Vintage of Macon' was first painted, it was full of vivid
greens and yellows. This blackening of pictures should be an
anxiety to all serious painters. Ruskin really did a great service
to Turner, perhaps even greater than the publication of <i>Modern
Painters</i>, when he rolled up the 'unfinished' oils and water-colours
and deposited them in the cellars of the National Gallery.
Our new joy in Turner, the rush of admiration and veneration
that came when those golden visions were exhibited in 1906,
could never have been had not they been protected from the light
for so many years: then, suddenly, to reveal their splendour.</p>

<h4>HE STUDIES AN ECLIPSE AND PAINTS THE SUNSET</h4>


<p>Throughout his life Turner produced, apart from the water-colours
for the engravers, which number nearly nine hundred
examples, two kinds of work&mdash;the pictures done for fame, and
those for his own delight&mdash;a 'Calais Pier,' and a 'Stonehenge at
Sunset': a 'Jason' and a 'Norham Castle.' It is hard to believe
that the broad and simple water-colour, 'Stonehenge at Sunset,'
with the magnificent sky, was done about the same time as the
'Calais Pier,' but it was 'Calais Pier' that made Turner known to
the public.</p>

<p>Henceforth he was rarely in want of commissions from
influential patrons, including the Earls of Egremont, Essex,
Lonsdale and Yarborough, Sir John Leicester, Sir John Soane and
others. He did not always sell his oil pictures; indeed, as the
years went on they remained in increasing numbers on his hands;
but that was partly his own desire. Turner was always loath to
part with his 'children.' The bulk of his fortune was made out
of the engravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Turner was now a successful man, but he was still, as
always, a student. The Sketch-Books, as I have said, reveal him
better than reams of commentary. Take, for example, the
'Eclipse' Sketch-Book of 1804, showing how he worked and
how he strove to understand phenomena, even if the wonders
studied did not apply actually to the work at hand. The 'Eclipse'
Sketch-Book is brief. Here are the descriptions of the six 'Eclipse'
drawings he made in black and white chalk:&mdash;'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Commencement of Eclipse.<br />
More than half of sun eclipsed.<br />
Sun nearly three-quarters eclipsed.<br />
Sun nearly lost among clouds.<br />
Three-quarters of sun in eclipse.<br />
Landscape with clouds, no sun.'<br />
</p>

<p>I shall always retain that mental picture of Turner alone, somewhere,
studying an eclipse; and also the picture of him, alone,
at Stonehenge, studying that solitude, and making of it a water-colour
that prefigured the freedom and sensitiveness of his later
work. I see it now, the brown, simple foreground, the ancient
stones erected to record the appearances of the sun, rising gauntly
in the middle distance, and half the drawing tingling with a sunset
sky. Was there ever a painter so obsessed by sunsets? But
towards the end of his life it was sunrises&mdash;always sunrises.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Moonlights, sunsets, sunrises! In them Turner sought light
and found hope.</p>

<p class="center">1805: AGED THIRTY</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS 'THE SHIPWRECK' FOR FAME, AND BEGINS A
SERIES OF 'DELIGHT STUDIES' FOR LOVE</h4>


<p>In the chronology of Turner's art life, the year 1805 may be
summed up in the words 'He painted "The Shipwreck."' That,
probably, was the art event of the year to him, but I like to think
of 1805 as the beginning of the period when his passion for colour
and atmosphere began to find expression in 'delight studies,' as
they may be called. I borrow the pretty word from Ruskin, who
called some of the most beautiful of the water-colours 'delight
drawings.' He also called some of the large pseudo-classical
works 'nonsense pictures.'</p>

<p>Between 1805 and 1810 Turner painted the twelve landscapes
in oil on thin veneer, found in one of the store-rooms of the
National Gallery, wrapped in brown paper, first exhibited in
1908, and now hanging in Room XIII. of the new Turner Gallery.
They formed, with forty early water-colours, the second instalment
of rediscovered Turners. How well I remember that day! How
well I recall the delight of seeing for the first time the 'Windsor
Castle from the River,' and the 'Tree-tops and Sky.' These were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
his between-whiles work; impulses of observation thrown off
while he was producing his mammoth pictures, the magnificent
as well as the 'nonsense' ones, painted to astonish the public,
and to show his superiority over all rivals alive or dead. But the
essential Turner was all the while expressing himself in such
'delight studies'&mdash;'unfinished,' merely because he had said all
he had to say, scanned frowningly by his judges and deposited
in the cellars of the National Gallery as not of sufficient importance
for exhibition.</p>

<p>And 'The Shipwreck,' which was the first of Turner's oil-pictures
to be engraved in mezzotint, what of 'The Shipwreck'?
Surely there is no need to describe it again. Dark, powerful,
splendidly impossible, it is in the same category as 'Calais Pier.'
Gaze at it and wonder, say for the hundredth time, that the
crowded boat in the centre could never live for an instant in
that terrific sea, that clouds do not throw such inky shadows,
and so on, and so on. Ruskin found in it 'delicate and mysterious
grey, instead of the ponderous black'; he also remarked,
which is obvious, that 'nobody is wet.' True, Turner did not
mean to be realistic when he painted 'The Shipwreck.' Perhaps
it needs a painter, who has struggled with sea subjects, to
perceive beneath the absurdities the strength and knowledge
that are the foundation of this work. Mr. Wyllie wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I am never tired of looking at this wonderful composition,
and the more I study it the more I find to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
at and admire. The masterly way in which knowledge
and artifice are woven together, the endless modulations
of light merging into shadow, the variety of the tones,
each little fleck of foam or swirl of inky water seeming
to play its part in the building up of the harmonious
whole. The swing and action of the figures, too, are also
among the marvels of this sombre record of man's battle
with the might of the remorseless elements.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently 'The Shipwreck' did not please Sir John Fleming
Leicester, afterwards Lord de Tabley, its purchaser in 1806 from
Turner's studio where it was exhibited, as much as it pleases
Mr. Wyllie to-day. Lord de Tabley exchanged his purchase for
'The Sun Rising Through Vapour,' and 'The Shipwreck' went
to form one of the mass of hoarded pictures in Queen Anne
Street, that eventually became the property of the nation, with
the 'delight studies,' the nineteen thousand 'pieces of paper,'
and the rest, making altogether the largest amount of work produced,
single-handed, by any artist since the world began.</p>

<h4>THE CHAOS OF THE 'HESPERIDES' AND THE PEACE
OF 'ABINGDON'</h4>


<p>Perhaps it is such pictures as 'The Goddess of Discord choosing
the Apple by Contention in the Garden of the Hesperides' that
folk have in mind when they say that they neither like nor understand
Turner. And do the pages that Ruskin has devoted to
the 'wonderful Hesperides,' that futilely magnificent attempt,
hardly worth attempting, to outvie Nicolas Poussin, entice the
observer to any closer observation of 'The Garden of the
Hesperides'? I think not. We are uninterested in Turner's
dragons, this or any other. What does it matter if 'the mighty
articulations of his body' do roll 'in great iron waves, a cataract
of coiling strength and crashing armour, down among the mountain
rents'? Yet how often, how very often, the wonderful mind of
Ruskin pierced to the truth. What could be better said than
this: 'Nearly all the faults of the picture are owing to Poussin;
and all its virtues to the Alps.'</p>

<p>Yes, Turner is here soaring to the mountain-tops, but he is
also on his high earthly horse. Yet, to look long enough at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
'Hesperides' is to be lost in admiration of those mad mountain
forms, and to see in them the giant workings of the magician's
mind. Turner's 'Ode to Discord,' inspired by the idea of the
'Hesperides,' inspires us less, I am afraid, than does the picture.
Here are two of the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'The guardian dragon, in himself a host,<br />
Awed by thy presence, slumbered at his post.'<br />
</p>

<p>'Venus and Adonis,' which he painted about this time in
emulation of Titian, and which was not exhibited until 1849, is
simpler, but let it pass. Turner had his golden visions, now as
afterwards, but he is too engrossed in competitive fury to rise
often to the simplicity of expressing simply his wonder at the
beauty of the world. In the 'Hesperides' Sketch-Book there is
a study for the famous and absurd Dragon, and on the same page
is a pen and ink suggestion for the beautiful picture of 'Abingdon'
exhibited in 1810. That was Turner: to be busy at the same
moment with the theatricality of the Dragon and the peace of
Abingdon. But his mind was ever restless, ever pushing forward.
In this year the <i>Liber Studiorum</i> was also engaging his
attention, and other things, too, that have become interesting
because he wrote them down. On page 1 of the 'Hesperides'
Sketch-Book there is a pencil drawing of a building with trees,
and written in the corner are these words&mdash;his momentary needs:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

essay on that subject, garnering his material from the Sketch-Books.</p>

<p class="center">1807: AGED THIRTY-TWO</p>

<h4>HE BEGINS THE 'LIBER STUDIORUM' AND EXHIBITS 'THE
SUN RISING THROUGH VAPOUR'</h4>


<p>On January 20, 1807, the first part, containing five plates, of the
<i>Liber Studiorum</i> was published. It would need a book to give
an adequate account of the history of this great work of Turner's,
begun in emulation of Claude Lorrain's <i>Liber Veritatis</i> and continued
until 1819, when, being a financial failure, it ceased to
appear. The original scheme of the <i>Liber</i> was for one hundred
plates, of which seventy only and the frontispiece were published,
leaving thirty to make up the number, twenty of which were in
various stages of etching and mezzotinting when the work ceased
in 1819. These have passed through many vicissitudes. Mr.
Frank Short has in recent years brought his accomplished art
to the engraving of sixteen of them.</p>

<p>Turner made the first drawings for the <i>Liber</i> when on a visit
to Mr. Wells at Knoekholt in Kent, who persuaded him to undertake
the work. He required 'much and long-continued spurring.'
At last, after he had been well goaded, one morning, half in a pet
he said: 'Zounds, Gaffer, there will be no peace with you till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
begin&mdash;well, give me a sheet of paper there, rule the size for me,
tell me what I shall take.' Then he began, and the first five
subjects 'were completed and arranged for publication.'</p>

<p>Mr. W. G. Rawlinson's volume is the authority on the <i>Liber</i>,
wherein Turner sought to 'display in engraved form the whole
range of his powers, and to rival on their own ground his predecessors
&mdash;Claude, Poussin, Rembrandt, Backhuysen, Cuyp,
Van de Velde, Wilson, Gainsborough, as well as the painters
of his day.' Turner made a hundred or more sepia drawings for
the work, eighty-four of which are in the Turner Collection at
Millbank. He etched with his own hand the foundation outline
on the copper plate, which was then handed over to the professional
engravers in mezzotint, who worked under his supervision, and a
hard taskmaster he proved.</p>

<p>To one who is enamoured of the lovely and luminous colour of
Turner in his supreme period, it is a fresh revelation of his power
to see a room hung with first states&mdash;rich, velvety, profound&mdash;of
the <i>Liber</i>, and to find how great is his spell even in monochrome.
I know two such rooms, and never does the spell fail to work.
The original sepia drawings have not this power in equal degree
with the engravings, which simply shows how well Turner knew
his business. On this subject Ruskin wrote the following letter
to a correspondent, which was published in the <i>Literary Gazette</i>
for November 13, 1858:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'You object that the drawings for the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>
are not included in my catalogue. They are not so,
because I did not consider them as, in a true sense, drawings
at all. They are merely washes of colour, laid roughly
to guide the mezzotint engraver in his first process; the
drawing properly so-called, was all put in by Turner when
he etched the plates, or superadded by repeated touchings
on the proofs. These brown guides, for they are nothing
more, are entirely unlike the painter's usual work, and in
every way inferior to it; so that students wishing to
understand the composition of the <i>Liber</i> must always work
from the plates, and not from these first indications of
purpose.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Little did Turner care that Claude's rough sketches in the
<i>Liber Veritatis</i> were mere memoranda of his pictures for the purpose
of identification. Turner put his whole heart and soul into
the <i>Liber</i>, and also into the business arrangements with the
engravers, and with the public; but that was the heart and soul
of a tradesman, not of an artist. Yet the artist is very evident
in his corrections on the proofs of the <i>Liber</i>, as of all his engraved
work. His way may have been rough, ungenerous and grasping,
but his corrections were always towards perfection.</p>

<p>Men love the <i>Liber</i>, men whom the modern movement in art
does not intrigue. One I know counts 'The Straw Yard' the
most desirable of his possessions; another has consoled himself
for the rigours of life by acquiring 'Norham Castle,' 'Raglan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Castle,' 'Calais Harbour,' 'Aesacus and Hesperie' (engraved by
Turner himself), 'The Source of the Arveron,' 'Ben Arthur,' 'The
Peat Bog,' 'The Junction of the Wye and the Severn,' and some
of the plates that Mr. Frank Short has engraved so beautifully.</p>

<p>At Christie's in the spring of 1910 I saw a private collector
acquire a complete set of the seventy-one published plates, all
in the first state except the 'Aesacus and Hesperie.' He paid but
three hundred and seventy guineas for the set, as the margins were
hidden by mounts and frames. Had the engravings been in
portfolios, plain to the eye as whole and uncut, he would probably
have had to pay double that price.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The meaning of the entire book,' says Ruskin, 'was
symbolised in the frontispiece, which he engraved with
his own hand&mdash;"Tyre at Sunset, with the Rape of Europa,"
indicating the symbolism of the decay of Europe by that
of Tyre, its beauty passing away into terror and judgment
(Europa being the mother of Minos and Rhadamathus).'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner's advertisement was simpler:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Intended as an illustration of Landscape Composition,
classed as follows: Historical, Mountainous, Pastoral,
Marine, and Architectural.'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">The letters on the seventy published plates indicate the class
to which they belong. Thus E. P. on the 'Woman with
Tambourine,' one of the five forming the first part, signifies
Elegant Pastoral. The proportions were as follows, Pastoral 14,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Elegant Pastoral 14, Mountainous 12, Architectural 11, Marine 11,
Historical 8.</p>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">This year, in spite of the anxiety and interest of issuing the
<i>Liber</i>, Turner had the energy to tilt at Wilkie.</p>

<p>In the Academy of the previous year high praise had been
awarded to Wilkie's 'Politicians'; so in 1807 Turner produced
'The Blacksmith's Shop' of which the original title was 'A
Country Blacksmith Disputing upon the price of Iron and the
price charged to the Butcher for Shoeing his Pony.' Turner
never lost faith in his own works. Twenty years later he
repurchased 'The Blacksmith' at Lord de Tabley's sale.</p>

<p>The other picture of this year was that glowing and characteristic
Turner, with the sun nearly in the centre of the picture,
where Claude was wont to place it, now called 'The Sun Rising
Through Vapour,' but formerly catalogued as 'The Sun Rising in
a Mist,' one of the first of his large pictures of light and atmosphere.
Some of his gold he outspreads for us, but he is still under the
domination of the crowded, littered foreground. 'It is curious,'
says Mr. Wyllie, 'that in this picture, a work that the painter
thought worthy to be bequeathed to the nation, the figures of
the fishermen should be taken almost exactly from a picture by
Teniers, and the men-of-war are the snub-nosed high-pooped ships
of Van de Velde's time, with sprit topmast at the bowsprit
end and lateen mizzens.'</p>

<p>This picture and the 'Dido Building Carthage,' exhibited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
1815, were bequeathed by Turner to the nation on the condition
that they should be hung between Claude's 'Marriage Festival of
Isaac and Rebecca' and the 'Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba.'
These four noble works are now the feature of the small Turner
room at the National Gallery which represents the painter since
the removal of the bulk of his pictures to the Tate Gallery. The
Claudes hang between the Turners, the precise condition contained
in the will having been cancelled by order of the Court of
Chancery. I do not think, as I have already stated, that Claude
suffers from the challenge.</p>

<p>Turner to-day, in the year of his triumph, has those who adore
him; but he also has his Laodiceans, and even those who dislike
his work and confess their dislike. So it has always been. Morris
Moore, when asked by the Lord Elcho of his day if he considered
Turner a distinguished artist, answered:&mdash;' No! Turner's early
works certainly indicate a good feeling for colour, but he is
absurdly overrated. The hanging of two such pictures as "The
Sun Rising Through Vapour," and the "Dido Building Carthage"
in the immediate vicinity of the finest Claudes and other noble
works of the National Gallery is a disgrace to the country.'</p>

<p>The country has survived many disgraces, and we can manage
to survive this one. All great men have had their detractors,
and sometimes the detractor who comes to curse remains to bless.
Such was the case of the Japanese artist, Yoshio Markino. On
page 140 of his book, <i>A Japanese Artist in London</i>, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Although I am myself such a great admirer of Turner
now, I was not so until Hara [a compatriot] came. In fact,
I hated Turner. Just a few days after Hara arrived in
London, he and I went to the National Gallery and sat
down on the seats in the Turner room.</p>

<p>'I said to him, "The greatest heroes in this world were
generally the greatest deceivers. Don't you think Turner
was one of the greatest heroes and deceivers?"</p>

<p>'"Why?"</p>

<p>'"Why! come and look at this picture of 'Trafalgar
Battle.' Look at these figures! Look at Nelson! What
an awful drawing! I think even a ten years' old child could
draw better figures. Oh, Turner was such a speculator!"'</p>

<p>
Hara made no reply. Hara waited. Later he conducted
Markino to the Tate Gallery, where the 'unfinished
Turners' were exposed. Markino continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I watched one picture more than twenty minutes,
then I went back to some certain pictures again. Those
wonderful atmospheric effects! The colours were breathing!
The tones were moving! I had quite forgotten myself
until the closing time came.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Later he returned to the National Gallery and the Turners
'looked to him quite different.' He became a Turnerite. On
page 144 he announces that his blind eyes are opened, that he
can now see 'the wonderful arts of Turner.'</p>

<h4>HE WRITES P.P. AFTER HIS NAME AND PAINTS IN A GARDEN
AT HAMMERSMITH</h4>


<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Yoshio Markino is not alone in his adverse criticism of the Battle
of Trafalgar, as seen from the mizzen starboard shrouds of the
<i>Victory</i>, known as 'The Death of Nelson, October 21st, 1805, at
the Battle of Trafalgar on board the <i>Victory.</i>' We all admire this
work for the splendour of the decorative scheme, the gathered
masses of golden brown, and the towering fantasy of the sails.
To me it is the most attractive of the earlier pictures. I never
look at the details; but those details aroused adverse criticism
while the picture was being painted, and after exhibition.
Turner cared little about accuracy; he was an artist, not an
illustrator. When he was asked to paint the 'Trafalgar' picture
as a companion to 'A Sea Fight' by de Loutherbourg, he had not
the slightest intention of producing an accurate representation of
the death of Nelson. He saw the scene decoratively, and decoratively
he painted it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px; ">

<p class="caption">Plate X. <span class="smcap">The Death of Nelson</span> (1808) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Some of the contemporary criticisms are amusing. Nelson's
Flag-Captain pronounced it to be 'more like a street scene than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
a battle, and the ships more like houses than men-of-war.' A
Greenwich pensioner is said to have exclaimed: 'I can't make
English of it, Sir. It wants altering altogether.' Another
remarked: 'What a Trafalgar! It is a d&mdash;&mdash;d deal more like a
brickfield.'</p>

<p>Turner was instructed daily, while painting 'The Death of
Nelson,' by the naval men about the court, and it is said that on
eleven successive occasions he altered the rigging to suit the fancy
of eleven successive naval visitors. Turner treated their
criticisms as jokes: they amused him. He knew precisely what
he meant to do. 'The Death of Nelson' was shown at the
British Institution; later he painted another version, which is
now at Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<p>To the Royal Academy he sent 'The Unpaid Bill, or the Doctor
reproving his Son's Prodigality.' I have not seen this picture,
which suggests Wilkie, and is probably not worth a journey of
discovery.</p>

<p>In the Royal Academy catalogue of this year, 1808, we find
for the first time the words, Professor of Perspective, after
Turner's name, and in addition to the address 64 Harley Street,
that of West End, Upper Mall, Hammersmith.</p>

<p>Turner was proud of his Professorship; this he showed by often
affixing, in his correspondence, the letters P.P. to his name.</p>

<p>As might be expected, his lectures on Perspective were unlike
the lectures of any other professor. Thornbury remarks: 'When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Turner lectured on perspective he was often at a loss to find words
to express the views he wished to communicate, but when the
spirit did stir within him, and he could find utterance to his
thoughts, he soared as high above the common order of lecturers
as he did in the regions of art.'</p>

<p>Thornbury, whose stories and comments one always quotes
with trepidation, his inaccuracies being so consistent, continues
with the following humorous paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Turner's want of expression rendered him almost
useless as a Professor of Perspective, though he took great
pains to prepare the most learned diagrams. He confessed
that he knew much more of the art than he could explain.
His sketch-books contain many drawings evidently made
in preparation for these lectures. On one memorable
occasion the hour had come for his lecture. The Professor
arrived&mdash;the buzz of the students subsided. The Professor
mounts his desk&mdash;every eye is fixed on him and on
his blackboard. But the Professor is uneasy&mdash;he is perturbed.
He dives now into one pocket&mdash;now into the other
&mdash;no! Now he begins, but what he says is 'Gentlemen,
I've been and left my lecture in the hackney-coach.' I
have no doubt the Professor would rather have painted
five epical pictures than have had to deliver one lecture
on Perspective.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the Turner relics lent by Mr. C. Mallord Turner to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Tate Gallery are the manuscripts of the Lectures on Perspective.
Mr. D. C. MCColl, in an article on 'Turner's Lectures at the Academy'
which he contributed to the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I am not yet in a position to say whether the labour
of disentangling that part of the text which deals with
the ordinary problems of perspective, would be repaid by
its result; but the series concludes with a review of
landscape painting by Turner, which certainly deserved to
be printed. However halting in expression, Turner's word
upon Dürer, Holbein, Titian, Rubens, Claude, Wilson and
Gainsborough should not be lost. The lecture also on
'Reflexes'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> reflections of light and colour&mdash;and
incidental passages in the other lectures should be put on
record.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner's word, halting in expression, upon many great painters,
together with his own aesthetic searchings, may be found, as the
reader knows, in the <i>Inventory.</i> In the 'Tabley' Sketch-Book,
dated 1808, there is a long involved passage on reflections, beginning
'Reflections not only appear darker but longer than the
object which occasions them, and if the ripple or hollow of the
wave is long enough to make an angle with the eye, it is on these
undulating lines that the object reflects, and transmits all perpendicular
objects lower towards the spectator....'</p>

<p>Turner's 'Windmill and Lock' in the collection of Sir
Frederick Cook at Richmond is clearly based on a close study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Rembrandt's 'Mill.' Pages 17 and 19 of the 'Greenwich' Sketch-Book
contain the following 'halting in expression' notes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'... Rembrandt is a strong instance of caution
as to reflected light and Correggio (?) to refracted light.
Two instances of the strongest class may be found in the
celebrated pictures of the Mill and La Notte. The Mill
has but one light, that is to say, upon the mill, for the
sky altho' a greater body or mass if reduced to black and
white yet is not perceptible of sun's ray by any indication
of form, but rather a glow of approaching light, but
the sails of the mill are loaded with the ... ray, while
all below is lost in ... gloom without the value of
Reflected light which even the sky commands, and the
ray upon the mill insists upon, while the 1/2 gleam upon
the water admits the reflection of the sky. Ev ...
twilight is all reflection but in Rembrandt it is all darkness
and gleam of light, etc'.</p></blockquote>

<p>I turn with relief from Turner on Perspective and Reflected
Light to the thought of his pretty country retreat at West End,
Upper Mall, Hammersmith, whither he went, it is said, to be
near de Loutherbourg, 'whose imaginative genius he much
admired.'</p>

<p>'A friend' communicated to Thornbury the following glimpse
of the life at Hammersmith:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'The garden, which ran down to the river, terminated
in a summer-house; and here, out in the open air, were
painted some of his best pictures. It was there that my
father, who then resided at Kew, became first acquainted
with him; and expressing his surprise that Turner could
paint under such circumstances, he remarked that lights
and room were absurdities, and that a picture could be
painted anywhere. His eyes were remarkably strong.
He would throw down his water-colour drawings on the
floor of the summer-house, requesting my father not to
touch them, as he could see them there, and they would be
drying at the same time.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In that happy mood no doubt he painted the seventeen
'beginnings' of pictures, exhibited for the first time in 1910 in Room
XI. of the new Turner Gallery&mdash;large beginnings of riparian and
rural scenes, free and decorative, that he no doubt exhibited in his
own studio, inviting patrons to commission 'finished' pictures
from these delightful suggestions.</p>

<p>He spent happy days making them, and in the garden at
Hammersmith, but it is probable that the important event of 1808
to Turner, ever ambitious, ever reaching forward, ever clutching
at fame, was the privilege of writing the letters P.P. after his
name.</p>

<h4>HE EXHIBITS THE GLOWING 'RIVER SCENE WITH CATTLE,'
AND REFUSES TO SELL 'BLIGH SAND'</h4>


<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner was an experimentalist, a seeker. If we did not possess
the actual dates when most of his pictures were painted or
exhibited, it would be difficult to assign a year to many. Some
are a recurrent surprise and joy, standing out from their period,
swift interpretations of something seen in nature, evocations of
colour or decorative harmony. Consider his 'River Scene with
Cattle' exhibited in his studio in 1809. For a long time it hung
apart from the other Turners at the Tate Gallery, and it was
always with a feeling of exhilaration that I encountered the
russet cattle standing by this golden river, golden clouds and
golden sand, and the two sailing barges gliding down the wide
estuary to the sea. The work is harmonious; nothing in it
offends. The children wading and playing on the shore are natural;
the cattle seen against the sky 'happen' as beasts do in nature,
and the whole picture lies bathed in a rich glow.</p>

<p class="caption">Plate XI. <span class="smcap">River Scene with Cattle</span> (1809) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Equally pleasant to look upon is 'Bligh Sand,' beautiful still,
but what must it have been in its first freshness? It was becoming
darker in Thornbury's time, which he ascribes to Turner's use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the dangerous sugar of lead. Although painted in 1809 'Bligh
Sand' was not exhibited at the Royal Academy until 1815. Sir
George Beaumont wished to buy it from the studio, but Turner,
having a grudge against Constable's patron for his lack of early
appreciation of his works, refused to sell 'Bligh Sand near
Sheerness.' Years later, when the Turner Gallery in Queen Anne
Street fell into disorder and untidiness, this beautiful picture
was placed in front of a broken window and used as a draught
protector. The Turnerian cats were able to squeeze past it as
they passed to and from the studio.</p>

<p>'London from Greenwich,' a quiet, meditative Turner, was
also painted in 1809, and 'Spithead: Boat's Crew Recovering an
Anchor,' also the little panel called 'The Garreteer's Petition.'
As nobody ever looks at this stupid little picture, I may remark
that it represents a poet working in his attic at midnight, that on
the walls of the attic are pasted a plan of Parnassus and a table
of fasts, and that the catalogue contained these lines, manifestly
Turner's, with the words 'long sought' italicised, pathetically
sincere coming from Turner:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Aid me, ye powers? O bid my thoughts to roll<br />
In quick succession, animate my soul;<br />
Descend my Muse, and every thought refine,<br />
And finish well my long, my <i>long sought</i> line.'<br />
</p>

<p>To this year belongs one of the 'Petworth' Sketch-Books
with views of the house and the park where he was to spend so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
many happy days. At Petworth House and at Farnley Hall he
was always welcome, and they are still places of pilgrimage for
Turnerians eager to see works which have never left the walls for
which they were painted.</p>

<p>Farnley Hall has been called Turner's shrine. Two of the
modern rooms are consecrated to him. 'One,' says Sir Walter
Armstrong, 'is hung round with drawings; in the other, three
great oil-pictures "Dordrecht," "Rembrandt's Daughter," and an
unnamed "Sea Piece" decorate the walls, while the tables groan
under albums and solander cases fitted with smaller things, and
those studies of birds which so moved the soul of Ruskin.'</p>

<p>1809 is also memorable as being the initial year of what Ruskin
called his 'Yorkshire period,' which continued with various
developments until about 1820. Ruskin, in his beautiful prose,
describes the characteristics of the Yorkshire drawings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Of all his drawings, I think those of the Yorkshire
series have the most heart in them, the most affectionate,
simple, unwearied serious finishings of truth. There is
in them little seeking after effect, but a strong love of
place; little exhibition of the artist's own powers or
peculiarities, but intense appreciation of the smallest local
minutiæ.... No alpine cloud could efface, no Italian
sunshine outshine the memories of the pleasant days of
Rokeby and Bolton; and many a simple promontory dim
with southern olive, many a lone cliff that stooped unnoticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
over some alien wave, was recorded by him with a love
and delicate care that were the shadows of old thoughts
and long-lost delights, whose charm yet hung like morning
mist above the chanting waves of Wharfe and Greta.'</p></blockquote>

<p>What was Turner like in appearance and dress about this
period? Well, the following description has been preserved:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The very moral of a master carpenter, with lobster-red
face, twinkling staring grey eyes, white tie, blue coat
with brass buttons, crab-shell turned up boots, large fluffy
hat and enormous umbrella.'</p></blockquote>

<p>A somewhat rough and rude description. His manners could
be rude and rough, too. A year or two later, Thomson of Duddingston
invited him to see his pictures. Turner came, and his
companion was eager to hear what the great landscape painter
would say about his works. He surveyed them carefully, but
the only remark he made was: 'You beat me in frames.'</p>

<h4>A QUIET YEAR AND AN EARLY GOLDEN VISION</h4>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Enter an early golden vision.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">The title in the catalogue is 'A Mountain Stream' and the
official description runs: 'The torrent winds swiftly round the base
of a rocky cliff surmounted by trees, and lashes itself into foam
here and there as it flows over boulders in the river bed.' I know
not where this attractive but somewhat hard golden vision was
painted, but its date is certainly about 1810. What a simplification
of vision and of title after such a medley as 'The Goddess of
Discord choosing the Apple of Contention in the Garden of the
Hesperides'; how reposeful is this unsophisticated statement of
the seeing eye after the piled up incidents of 'Calais Pier.'</p>

<p class="caption">Plate XII. <span class="smcap">A Mountain Stream</span> (<i>about</i> 1810) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">It would seem that Turner was in a reflective peace-with-the-world
mood in this year, as indeed he had been since he painted
the seventeen large 'beginnings' of riparian and rural oil-pictures
mentioned in Chapter XV. To 1810 we may ascribe
the placid 'Windsor' and the pastoral 'Abingdon' which
was sold to Mr. G. Hibbert, and re-purchased by Turner at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the Hibbert sale in 1829. It must have been an interesting sight
to watch Turner re-purchasing his sold pictures, and taking them
back to his cheerless gallery. In later years he owned three
houses, two in Harley Street and one in Queen Anne Street,
communicating mysteriously at the back, and leaving the corner
building in other hands. The houses are now pulled down, and the
tablet commemorating his residence is affixed to the new building
of the Howard de Walden estate office in Queen Anne Street. It
may have been about this period that Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;
paid Turner the visit, an account of which was communicated to
Thornbury by Mr. Rose of Jersey:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Two ladies, Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash; and Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; once paid
him a visit in Harley Street, an extremely rare (in fact, if
not the only) occasion of such an occurrence, for it must
be known he was not fond of parties prying, as he fancied,
into the secrets of his <i>ménage.</i> On sending in their names,
after having ascertained that he was at home, they were
politely requested to walk in, and were shown into a large
sitting-room without a fire. This was in the depth of
winter; and lying about in various places were several
cats without tails. In a short time our talented friend
made his appearance, asking the ladies if they felt cold.
The youngest replied in the negative; her companion,
more curious, wished she had stated otherwise, as she
hoped they might have been shown into his sanctum or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
studio. After a little conversation he offered them wine
and biscuits, which they partook of for the novelty, such
an event being almost unprecedented in his house. One of
the ladies bestowing some notice upon the cats, he was
induced to remark that he had seven, and that they came
from the Isle of Man.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The Wreck of the <i>Minotaur</i> on the Haak Sands' was a
subject after his own heart. I have not seen this sea-piece, which
Mr. Wyllie describes as the most 'splendid sea-picture that has
ever been painted; the power of the waves and the littleness of
man have never been so magnificently suggested.' That is high
praise for a Turnerian sea-picture by a modern painter of the sea.</p>

<p>Yes, a quiet year this seems to have been for Turner, marked
by the repose of the 'Abingdon' and the 'Windsor,' the stately
pictures of 'Lowther Castle' at noon and evening, 'Petworth
House, Dewy Morning,' and that golden dream called 'A
Mountain Stream,' to which probably he gave no title, a little
hard, a little tight, but an augury of the subtle effects of light
and vapour that were to float from his brush when the chief had
advanced to a complete realisation of his vision of essential beauty.</p>

<h4>'APOLLO KILLING THE PYTHON' AND A PICNIC</h4>


<p>'The Python was a dragon which lived at Crissa, in the vicinity
of Delphi, and committed great havoc among cattle and the
inhabitants. The Pythian games there celebrated were established
in commemoration of the destruction of the Python by
Apollo.' So runs the official description in the catalogue appended
to 'Apollo Killing the Python.' When it was exhibited in 1811,
Turner supplied six lines from the <i>Hymn of Callimachus.</i>
beginning:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Envenora'd by thy darts, the monster coil'd,<br />
Portentous, horrible, and vast his snake-like form....'<br />
</p>

<p>'Mercury and Herse' was illumined by this couplet from
Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">>
'Close by the sacred walls in wide Munichio's plain,<br />
The God well pleased beheld the virgin train!'<br />
</p>

<p>How tiresome these descriptions and tags of verse seem, and
how old-fashioned 'Apollo Killing the Python' looks, yet I have
only to gaze at it for five minutes to be hypnotised by its
grandeur; but the mood passes, and Ruskin's panegyric does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
restore it, that succinct panegyric&mdash;'This is one of the very
noblest of all Turner's works, and therefore I do not scruple to say,
one of the noblest pictures in the world.'</p>

<p>The pages of <i>Modern Painters</i> roll on in magnificent and
eloquent periods on 'Apollo Killing the Python.' Certain of the
passages one knows by heart, few of them have anything to do
with the art of Turner, and some are untrue, such as&mdash;'He was
without hope'; 'Turner painted the labour of men, their sorrow
and their death.' Often Ruskin's prose leaves us breathless,
almost crushed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Fancy him [the dragon] moving, and the roaring of
the ground under his rings; the grinding down of the
rocks by his toothed whorls; the skeleton glacier of him
in thunderous march, and the ashes of the hills rising round
him like smoke, and encompassing him like a curtain.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The quotation from Ovid and the theme of 'Apollo Killing
the Python' suggest that Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> was one of the
few books that Turner really studied and read through, probably
again and again, as he found most of his subjects for classical
pictures in Ovid. Monkhouse considers that with the exception
of 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus,' there is none greater than the
'Apollo Killing the Python.' That must remain a matter of
opinion. To me it seems that Ovid only confused Turner's
imagination. He needed no classical legend to paint such masterpieces
as 'Norham Castle at Sunrise,' 'The Evening Star,' 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Burial of Wilkie,' 'Rain, Steam and Speed,' 'The Snowstorm,'
or the later interpretations of Venice.</p>

<p>Let us turn from books, even from the classic <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
to nature, to Devonshire, where in this year, or thereabouts,
Cyrus Redding met him, to whom we owe delightful accounts
of Turner in holiday mood.</p>

<p>On one of these excursions Turner once actually gave a picnic
'in excellent taste.' 'Our host,' says Redding, was 'agreeable
but terse, blunt, and almost epigrammatic at times. Never given
to waste his words, nor remarkably choice in their arrangement,
they were always in their right place and admirably effective.'
An account has also been preserved of a scene in an inn where
they conversed until nearly midnight, when Turner laid his head
upon the table and was soon sound asleep. They were up with
the sun, and it was at that early hour that Turner made his
sketch for 'Crossing the Brook' exhibited in 1815. Another
excursion was by sea. The morning was squally, and the sea
rolled boisterously into the sound. Then they landed and&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Turner was all the while quiet, watching the troubled
scene, and it was not unworthy his notice. The island,
the solitary hut upon it, the bay in the bight of which it
lay, and the long gloomy Bolt Head to seaward, against
which the waves broke with fury, seemed to absorb the
entire notice of the artist, who scarcely spoke a syllable.
While the fish were getting ready, Turner mounted nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the highest point of the island rock, <i>and seemed writing
rather than drawing.</i> The wind was almost too violent for
either purpose; what he particularly noted he did not say.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is a specimen of Turner's conversation, showing how
true was his observation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'He was looking at a seventy-four gun ship, which
lay in the shadow under Saltash. The ship seemed one
dark mass.</p>

<p>'"I told you that would be the effect," said Turner,
referring to some previous conversation. "Now, as you
observe, it is all shade."</p>

<p>'"Yes, I perceive it; and yet the ports are there."
'"We can only take what is visible&mdash;no matter what
may be there. There are people in the ship; we don't
see them through the planks."'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner's friends could have told Ruskin how untrue was such
a statement as 'he was without hope.' Like ordinary mortals
he had his good days and his bad days, his hours of fun and his
hours of gloom, his moments of kindness and his moments of
cruelty.</p>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">'His spirits,' says Thornbury, 'were high, deep as were occasionally
his fits of melancholy.' Once he wrote a letter to Calcott, in
which he drew a wild duck or mallard, a pun on his second name;
and as to his kindness, there is the story, one of many, of his
generosity at the 1811 Academy to a young artist called Bird,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
whose picture had been crowded out. Turner begged the Hanging
Committee to restore the work, insisting that it was too good to
be rejected. They agreed, but declined to alter the hanging.
Turner had another long look at Bird's picture, and then, taking
down one of his own of the same size, hung Bird's in its place.
I wonder was that 'one of his own' the 'Scarborough,' exhibited
this year, the large, beautiful, and simple sketch for which is
in the National Collection, one of the 'unfinished' water-colours
reproduced in these pages.</p>

<p>We begin to understand something of Turner the man as well
as of Turner the artist. As an artist he seems the more wonderful,
the more one studies him. To-day I looked again at his
'Innsbruck,' his 'Sketch of an Italian Town,' and his 'Lake of
Brienz' at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Those three water-colours,
stages in his development, are sufficient to make an
ordinary painter's reputation.</p>

France in a day, and carried it home, which rapidity so
captivated the Constable that he ordered another large
one, which he likewise began, finished and sent home, that (?)
well paid for by purses of gold and as Constable commented
which would be first weary, but upon the production of the
fifth the employer sent two purses and declined rivalship
with the artist's powers of rapidity.</p>

<p>The next Sketch-Book is short, and devoted to Farnley.
The idea of the 'Snowstorm, Hannibal and His Army Crossing
the Alps,' came to Turner through a storm he saw at
Farnley.</p>

<p>One wild day Turner called loudly from the doorway:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hawkey! Hawkey! come here! Look at this thunderstorm&mdash;isn't
it wonderful? Isn't it sublime?'</p>

<p>And while he talked he was making notes of its form and
colour on the back of a letter. Young Mr. Hawkes proposed a
drawing block but Turner said the letter did very well. He was
absorbed, entranced, while the storm rolled and swept, and the
lightning flashed over the Yorkshire hills. When the storm had
passed Turner returned to the room and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'There, Hawkey. In two years you will see this again, and
call it "Hannibal Crossing the Alps."'</p>

<p>We look at this tumultuous picture to-day and think of that
thunderstorm at Farnley as we watch the lurid sun through the
storm of snow that threatens to overwhelm the muddled, huddled,
Carthaginian army. Yes: it is wonderful as was the thunderstorm
to Turner. This picture, in a category between his classical
works and his sunlight visions, was accompanied by nine halting,
unpoetical lines from the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>, this being the first
time that a quotation from that poem was attached to the R. A.
catalogues. The title was modified, probably, from Campbell's
<i>Pleasures of Hope.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Craft, treachery, and fraud&mdash;Salassian force&mdash;<br />
Hung on the fainting rear; then plunder seized<br />
The victor and the captive,&mdash;Saguntum's spoil<br />
Alike became their prey; still the chief advanc'd,<br />
Looked on the sun with hope; low, broad, and wan<br />
While the fierce archer of the downward year<br />
Stains Italy's blanched barrier with storms.<br />
In vain each pass, ensanguined deep with dead<br />
Or rocky fragments, wide destruction roll'd.'<br />
</p>

<p>And the eyes fall upon two lines that mean something, that
aptly express the thought of the dumb poet, the lines which
I quoted in Chapter III.,&mdash;'Still the chief advanced, Looked
on the sun with hope'&mdash;Turner's fitting epitaph, and life-long
aspiration. He added to the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i> off and on for
forty years, and it dealt with almost every conceivable subject
from the Deluge to Napoleon.</p>

<p>This year his town address is given as Queen Anne Street
West, but, as I have already explained, this did not mean a change
of domicile, as the three houses, two in Harley Street and one in
Queen Anne Street, were the same dwelling with a communication
at the back.</p>

<p>Turner, Thornbury tells us, almost entirely rebuilt his house
in Queen Anne Street, and while all the houses round it from time
to time smartened themselves up, this alone remained unchanged.
The Gallery in later years, as we know, became most dilapidated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The oiled paper of the skylight hung down in black,
sooty, furred slips. The damp here and there had free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
access; and it is certain that while many of the pictures
ripened and improved, others were cracked, warped, chilled,
and seriously injured. Both the "Hero and Leander,"
and "The Building of Carthage," suffered. Mr. E. Godall
tells me that in one picture particularly, a great white
button of paint that had stood for the sun had dropped
off.</p>

<p>'"I think some one has picked it off intentionally,"
he could not help saying.</p>

<p>'"I think he has," replied Turner, quite unmoved.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner was 'quite unmoved.' As he grew older he cared less
and less for the things that most people deem so important. His
golden visions did not depend upon material accessories. May
we not find a hint of his almost inarticulate inner life in that
little red book unearthed by Thornbury from his studio, where,
amid notes about chemistry, memoranda as to colours, and prophylactics
against the Maltese plague, are certain scraps of verse,
something about 'Anna's Kiss,' 'A Look Back,' 'A Toilsome
Dream,' 'Human Joy, Ecstasy, and Hope'?</p>

<p>But I am anticipating. We are still in the year 1812 and
Turner is preparing 'A Frosty Morning' for exhibition, and
considering one of his earliest series of book illustrations,&mdash;<i>The

1812, although the first seven plates, including 'St. Michael's
Mount,' 'Poole,' and 'Land's End,' were not published until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
1814. The last issue was in 1826. De Wint, Clennell and Prout
were also contributors to <i>The Southern Coast.</i> Turner was to
receive seven and a half guineas apiece for the drawings, which
was increased later to ten and twelve guineas. But in spite of
that advance he became dissatisfied and broke with W. B. Cooke,
the line engraver and publisher of <i>The Southern Coast.</i> Business
relations with Turner were not easy.</p>

<h4>HOAR FROST AT SUNRISE THAT HAS VANISHED FROM
'A FROSTY MORNING'</h4>

<p>Turner was anxious about his health this year, if we may judge
from an entry in the 'Chemistry and Apuleia' Sketch-Book
detailing the symptoms of the Maltese plague, and the cure. A
'receipt for covering Linen to make it impenetrable to water,
etc.,' follows, then 'Study of Sky,' 'River with Hills on Either
Side,' notes as to varnishes and sketches of nymphs dancing,
showing that his anxiety about the symptoms of the Maltese
plague had passed away.</p>

<p>In this year he exhibited the attractive and popular 'A Frosty
Morning: Sunrise,' with a quotation from Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>:
'The rigid hoar-frost melts before his beam'; also 'The Deluge'
with some lines from <i>Paradise Lost</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">'... down rush'd the rain</span><br />
Impetuous, and continued till the earth<br />
No more was seen.'<br />
</p>

<p>These subjects indicate Turner's versatility and determination
to impress the public with one thing, if not with another. 'A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Frosty Morning: Sunrise' is infinitely nearer to the real Turner
than 'The Deluge.' It is a pleasant picture, simple and direct,
a true transcript of nature; but where is the hoar-frost which
made such a sensation when the picture was exhibited? It is
gone like the bloom on the Impressionist pictures in the Caillebotte
Collection in the Luxembourg Gallery. The form of 'A Frosty
Morning' remains, and it still suggests the chill of a winter sunrise,
but gone is the sparkling hoar-frost.</p>

<p>Archdeacon Fisher writing to Constable about one of his
landscapes said: 'I have heard your great picture spoken of
here by no inferior judge as one of the best in the Exhibition.
I only like one better and that is a picture of pictures, the 'Frost'
by Turner. But then you need not repine at this decision of
mine; you are a great man and, like Bonaparte, are only to be
beaten by a frost.'</p>

<p>That is something; to have one's Academy contribution
described as 'a picture of pictures,' and by one whose allegiance
was given whole-heartedly to a rival painter. It would be interesting
to know what Constable thought of Turner's 'Frosty
Morning: Sunrise.' Already you perceive that Turner is forsaking
his rivalries, and 'finding himself' with nothing between his vision
and a Sunrise. There is a personal note in this picture. The
horses were studied from the friendly steed 'Crop-ear,' somewhat
stiff in the fore-legs, which Turner used to drive about the country
when he was staying at Sandycombe. The young Trimmers said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
that Turner painted faster than he drove, and Thornbury remarked
that he could never draw a horse; but I am sure that he could
paint a hoar-frost at sunrise. And if this picture had been happily
rolled up and kept in the cellars of the National Gallery with the
other sunrise pictures, we might to-day still be enjoying Turner's
sparkling vision of hoar-frost.</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS MORE CLASSICAL PICTURES, TURNS AUTHOR,
AND IS HAPPY AT SANDYCOMBE</h4>

<p>More classical pictures with the annoying foregrounds, the dream
buildings reflected in the still water, and the beauty of the
Turnerian distance. You can take your choice between 'Dido
and Æneas leaving Carthage on the Morning of the Chase,' and
'Apuleia in search of Apuleius,' which won the premium at the
British Institution for the best landscape of the year. Unblushingly
Turner founded it on one of Claude's sketches in his <i>Liber
Veritatis.</i> Although he set himself to rival Claude before all the
world, sure of his own victory, he had not the slightest hesitation
in basing his prize picture on a sketch by Claude.</p>

<p>But there is nothing classical or imitative about his 'Review
at Portsmouth' Sketch-Book of this year with its innumerable
sketches of shipping, and its usual stumbling scraps of verse such
as&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'The floating bulwark lies<br />

Hence gloomy evil infamy's.'<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1814, as I have said in Chapter XIX., the first seven
parts of <i>The Southern Coast</i> were published, and in this year
Turner appears as an author with ill-success. He had attempted
to describe 'St. Michael's Mount' for <i>The Southern Coast</i>, and
Combe, the editor to whom Turner's description had been sent,
writes thus to Cooke, the publisher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Friday afternoon.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am really concerned to be obliged
to say that Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;'s account is the most extraordinary
composition I have ever read. It is impossible for me to
correct it, for in some parts I do not understand it. The
punctuation is everywhere defective, and here I have done
what I could, and have sent the proof to Mr. Bulmer. I
think the revise should be sent to Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, to request
his attention to the whole, and particularly the part that I
have marked as unintelligible. In my private opinion, it is
scarcely an admissible article in its present state; but
as he has signed his name to it, he will be liable to the
sole blame for its imperfections.&mdash;Your faithful humble
servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">w. c.</span>'</p></blockquote>

<p>Cooke suppressed Turner's composition; but Combe, evidently
knowing his man, told Cooke that unless he wished to drive
Turner 'stark staring mad' he must be sure to send him corrected
sheets of the suppressed article. The end was that Turner's
contribution was cancelled. In 1827 all connection between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Cooke and Turner was broken off. Turner was clearly in the
wrong. How could anybody work with this genius? 'His
mind,' says Hamerton, 'was subject to confused changes and
irregularities about all transactions, owing to its want of method
and clearness.' The Freemasons' Hall affair between Turner and
Cooke must have been amusing to some, painful to others.
'It was,' says Thornbury, 'a dispute about the return of some
drawings (I think of the <i>Annual Tour</i>) that both claimed.
Turner's red face grew white with the depth of his rage, Cooke
grew hot and red, and "must," "shan't," "shall," "rogue" flew
about.'</p>

<p>In this year Turner bought Solus Lodge, later called Sandycombe
Lodge, on the road between Twickenham and Isleworth.
There his old father used to dig in the garden, and look after
the household, and there Turner spent probably some of the
happiest days of his life. He was friendly with the Trimmer
family of Heston, four miles off, and the Vicar, the Rev. Henry
Scott Trimmer, tried to teach Turner Greek in return for lessons
in painting, but he could never overcome the difficulty of
the verbs, and finally had to renounce the attempt. 'I fear I
must give it up, Trimmer,' he said; 'you get on better with your
painting than I with my Greek.' The young Trimmers, who
were living when Thornbury wrote his <i>Life of Turner</i>, describe
him as a slovenly old man (he was still far off fifty), very sociable
and wont to make them laugh. The days must have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pleasantly at Sandycombe, sketching in oils on a large canvas
in a boat, painting in the summer-house of the garden which
ran down to the Thames, fishing, and driving old 'Crop-ear'
about the country. The young Trimmers give a much pleasanter
picture of Turner than most of his friends and contemporaries, but
then they loved him. They describe Queen Anne Street as homely,
and say that when they visited him they were always welcome
to what he had, and that he would offer them cake and wine,
and stuff the cake into their pockets. And they show Turner in
modest mood before the work of other painters, telling how he
spoke with rapture of a picture probably by Poussin, 'Jonah cast
on Shore,' describing it as wonderful; and how he was enthusiastic
about Gainsborough's execution, and Wilson's tone. And how,
one day, looking at a Van de Velde, Turner said, 'I can't paint
like him.'</p>

<p>But he could. Van de Velde is to-day in the trough of his
own dark seas, and Turner is on the crest of his own opalescent
waves beneath a sky flushed with his dreams of colour.</p>

<h4>'A WONDERFUL YEAR' AND A TURNERIAN LOVE-LETTER</h4>


<p>Eighteen hundred and fifteen was a wonderful year in the history
of Europe, and it has also been called a wonderful year in the
art history of Turner. He sent eight pictures to the Royal
Academy, and among them were 'Crossing the Brook,' 'Dido
Building Carthage, or the Rise of the Carthaginian Empire,' and
'Bligh Sand near Sheerness.' Some consider 'Crossing the
Brook' as the finest Turner, others regard it as rather old-fashioned
with its conventional trees and domestic foreground, but all
like its English character, the cool beauty of the colour, the white
clouds that curl in the grey-blue sky, the wooded hills that rise
from the Tamar, dividing Devon and Cornwall, and the miles
of faint, fair, distant country. 'Crossing the Brook' was a favourite
of Turner's, and so was the magnificent 'Dido Building
Carthage.' This classical triumph, a shout of colour, with 'The
Sun Rising Through Vapour' flank the two Claudes in the
National Gallery, Turner's message of rivalry from the grave.
In life he would not part with 'Dido Building Carthage.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Chantrey tried to buy the picture more than once, but found the
price rose higher each time.</p>

<p>'Why, what in the world, Turner, are you going to do with
the picture?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Be buried in it, to be sure,' growled Turner.</p>

<p>This year, too, we have the record of what has been described
as Turner's second attempt at marriage, which I do not think
amounts to much more than his first love-affair. At the end of
the following letter will be found the offer of marriage; the lady
in question was a relation of the Trimmers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Queen Anne Street,
Tuesday</span>, <i>August 1st,</i> 1815.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I lament that all hope of the pleasure
of seeing you or getting to Heston must for the present
probably vanish. My father told me on Saturday last
when I was as usual compelled to return to town the same
day, that you and Mrs. Trimmer would leave Heston for
Suffolk as to-morrow, Wednesday. In the first place I
am glad to hear that her health is so far established as to
be equal to the journey, and to give me your utmost hope
for her benefiting by the sea air being fully realised,
'twill give me great pleasure to hear, and the earlier the
better.</p>

<p>'After next Tuesday, if you have a moment's time to
spare, a line will reach me at Farnley Hall, near Otley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Yorkshire, and for some time, as Mr. Fawkes talks of
keeping me in the north by a trip to the Lakes, and until
November; therefore I suspect I am not to see Sandycombe.
Sandycombe sounds just now in my ears as an act
of folly when I reflect how little I have been able to be there
this year and less chance perhaps for the next. In looking
forward to a continental excursion, and poor Daddy seems as
much plagued with weeds as I am with disappointment&mdash;that
if Miss&mdash;&mdash;would but waive bashfulness, or in other words
make an offer instead of expecting one, the same might
change occupiers; but not to trouble you further allow me
with most sincere respect to Mrs. Trimmer and family, to
consider myself.&mdash;Yours most truly obliged,</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">J. M. W. Turner</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The reference to Miss&mdash;&mdash;does not suggest the heart of a
burning lover: no, Turner's heart was in his work, and also, just
now, in the prospect of a 'continental excursion.'</p>

<h4>SKIES! SKIES! SKIES!</h4>


<p>The Sketch-Books of the period are full of Yorkshire and Farnley
subjects, and one of them contains a fragment of a letter from Mr.
Walter Fawkes concluding: 'Everybody is delighted with your
"Mill." I sit for a long time before it every day.' The 'Mill'
which delighted Mr. Fawkes may be the 'View of Otley Mills
with the River Wharfe and Mill Weir,' sold at Christie's in 1890.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that anybody has ever sat for a long time
every day, or any day, before Turner's two contributions to the
Academy of this year, 'The Temple of Jupiter Panellenius
Restored,' and the 'View of the Temple of Jupiter Panellenius.'
I turn from them to the Sketch-Book labelled simply 'Skies.'
Inside one of the covers there is a sketch in pencil of a sky with the
following in Turner's handwriting: 'Yellow Light. Blue Shadows.
Red Crimson Light.' Following this there are sixty leaves and
on each leaf is a study of a sky. How far they seem removed
from the Temple of Jupiter Panellenius. Skies! Skies! Skies!
And on the last leaf of this sketch-book is a pencil drawing showing
'An Interior with open doors leading to a garden,' as if, in this
year of sky watching, he must, even when within doors, be looking
out towards the light.</p>

<h4>HE SELLS FIFTY WATER-COLOURS TO MR. FAWKES
OF FARNLEY HALL</h4>


<p>The 'Rhine Tour' Sketch-Book of 1817 suggests that Turner
was in the mood to be careful about his material necessities, one
can hardly call them comforts. Written inside the covers are
the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Boots, Pouch, Fever Medicine, Bark, Pencils, Colours,'
followed by, '<i>Vier ist myn Simmer</i>&mdash;Where is my chamber?'
On a later page I find the following list:&mdash;</p>

<p>'3 Shirts, 1 Night ditto, A Razor, a Ferrell for Umbrella, a
Pair of Stockings, a waistcoat, 1/2 dozen of Pencils, 6 Cravats, 1
large ditto, 1 Box of Colours'&mdash;and then, on the next leaf, the
inevitable 'Study of a Sky.'</p>

<p>On a page of the 'Dort' Sketch-Book is this note of a 'thing
seen' that he may have thought of painting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'Float of Timber&mdash;1000 feet long at least, lashed into
two pieces and guided by the cross piece of timber which
hauls either part of the float or buoy in two lines&mdash;and

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
During this three weeks' tour in the Rhine district Turner
produced no fewer than fifty drawings at the rate of about three
a day. He first, says Mr. Rawlinson, stained the paper a uniform
bluish-grey, which, although itself sombre in tone, effectively
shows up the body-colour work, and must have effected an
immense economy of time as compared with ordinary transparent
colour. Returning to England he took the roll of drawings
straight to Farnley Hall, and Mr. Fawkes bought them for five
hundred pounds. For a long time they remained in a portfolio,
but a few years ago some of them were sold at Christie's. Mr.
Rawlinson possesses one of them, the delicate and romantic
'Goarhausen and Katz Castle.'</p>

<p>Other drawings of this period are the rich and forceful 'Bonneville,
Savoy' in the Salting collection at the British Museum, a
majestic water-colour; that vision of yellow foliage, blue water,
and outstretched yellowy-blue country, 'The Lake of Nemi,' and
the more academic 'Turin from the Church of the Superga,' the
foreground with its artless groups not very attractive, but the
distant glimpse of the snow mountains, and the white fleecy clouds
seen against the blue sky, as lovely as Turner could make them,'
and that is saying much.</p>

<p>Probably in this year he began the glorious illustrations to
Dr. Whitaker's <i>History of Richmondshire</i>, which contains some of
his finest water-colours. The first plate was published in 1819,
the last in 1822. Turner was paid twenty-five guineas a drawing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and the magnificent enterprise cost the publishers, Messrs Longman,
ten thousand pounds. 'The Crook of the Lune' is one of the
finest of the series. 'You can find at least twenty different walks
in it&mdash;yet all this wealth of exquisite detail is perfectly subordinated
to the unity and harmony of the composition as a whole.'
Another of the Richmondshire drawings is the 'Hornby Castle' in
the Victoria and Albert Museum, which, through constant exposure
to light, is a wreck of its former beauty.</p>

<p>His chief Royal Academy picture of 1817 was 'The Decline of
the Carthaginian Empire.' It has disappeared from the National
Gallery, loaned, I suppose, to some provincial museum, where a
Turner, even a bad Turner, is a Turner. I will quote from the
catalogue of 1817 its full title, and tag of verse by Turner, and say
no more about 'The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire.'</p>

demanded from her such terms as might either force her

give up even their arms and their children.</p>

<h4>'THE ABBOTSFORD TURNERS,' AND AN AUCTION PRICE
OF A TURNER WATER-COLOUR</h4>


<p>'The Field of Waterloo,' exhibited in 1818, with its obvious
quotation from Byron, is as dead as rider and horse, friend and foe
piled in the foreground. It now hangs on the outer stair-case of
the new Turner Gallery, as if in disgrace.</p>

<p>Turner journeyed north this year to make drawings for the
<i>Provincial Antiquities of Scotland</i>, for which Sir Walter Scott
was gratuitously writing the letterpress. He did not meet Scott
on this occasion, but the artist and author met in 1831, when
Turner was illustrating Cadell's edition of <i>Scott's Poetical and
Prose Works.</i> The <i>Provincial Antiquities</i> drawings, which
include the important 'Edinburgh from the Calton Hill,' were
afterwards presented by the publishers to Sir Walter in recognition
of his aid in the production of the book. For a long time they
hung at Abbotsford, and the group was known by the honoured
name of the 'Abbotsford Turners.' They are now scattered.</p>

<p>It would take a lifetime to follow the vicissitudes of all Turner's
water-colours, when they were painted, and where they are to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The 'Heysham' of this year, with the elaborate lovely sky, is in
the Salting Collection at the British Museum. To the 'Heysham'
Ruskin devoted half a dozen pages in his <i>Elements of Drawing.</i></p>

<p>Turner's water-colours are constantly changing hands. The
gleaming eyes of the wizard, that some called covetous, would
indeed have looked covetous could he have known that, in the
twentieth century, a fine water-colour of his best period, for which
he received a few guineas, may realise two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>'What do you think the Turner "Lake of Lucerne" will fetch?'
said a Turner collector to me the day before an auction in June
1910. 'Oh, two thousand pounds,' I answered.</p>

<p>'Absurd!' he cried. It brought one thousand nine hundred
and ninety-five pounds. I believe that there are certain men who
would rather possess a fine Turner water-colour than any other
work of art.</p>

<h4>TURNER'S FIRST VISIT TO ITALY, AND AN EXHIBITION
IN GROSVENOR PLACE</h4>


<p>The route of Turner's memorable first visit to Italy may be
followed in detail in the Sketch-Books, between No. CLXXI., called
the 'Route to Rome,' and No. CXCII., devoted to the 'Return from
Italy.' His divagations and pauses are recorded on innumerable
pages of sketches, studies, comments, and criticisms of pictures.
Here are his cursory notes on a copy he made of a sea-piece by
Claude:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Date 1631 or 81 Roma&mdash;he died at 82. Raf. 1512.'</p>

<p>'Wonderful grey green,'  'arm in light,' 'The mast Red&mdash;all painted at once with the colour.'</p></blockquote>

<p>We find him at Venice, Rimini, Ancona, Naples, Paestum,
Pompeii and Sorrento&mdash;anywhere, everywhere. Turn the pages.
Here he is in the Vatican with a Sketch-Book labelled 'Vatican
Fragments' containing such comments as 'Christ by Guercino
beautifully color'd,' 'A Hare by Albert Dürer,' and  'Annunciation.
The Angel very elegant.' On the way from Ancona to
Rome his hand tries to transcribe what his watchful eyes note:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Loretto to Recanata. Colour of the hills Wilson
Claude, the olives the light ..., when the sun shone
green, the ground reddish green grey and apt to Purple,
the Sea quite Blue, under the Sun a warm vapour, from
the Sun Blue relieving (?) the shadow of the olive Trees
dark, while the foliage light on the whole when in the
shadow a quiet grey. Beautiful dark green yet warm, the
middle Trees, yet Bluish in parts, the distance; the
aqueduct reddish, the foreground light grey in shadow.'</p></blockquote>

<p>But that visit to Italy, the magic and colour of it, the pictures
he saw, the sunrises and the sunsets he studied, appear to have
affected his art unfavourably for a time, to have disturbed him
with florid and fantastic fancies. It was as if he became intoxicated
with the art and aspect of Italy.</p>

<p>There is no hint of Italy in the works he exhibited this
year. I can stand for a long time before 'The Meuse, Orange
Merchant-men going to Pieces on the Bar,' lost in admiration
of the wonderful sky, trying to avoid looking at the
foolish fishermen, and remembering a phrase I have read somewhere
that 'with this picture he gave the <i>coup de grâce</i> to Van
de Velde.'</p>

<p>Another work of 1819 was the huge, neat and amusing view
of 'England, Richmond Hill on the Prince Regent's Birthday,'
now hanging in a place of honour in the new Turner Gallery. It
dominates the wall, whereas in its old place above the line in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

<p>'Richmond,' and 'Rome from the Vatican,' exhibited the
following year, are the largest pictures Turner painted.</p>

<p>In May and June, presumably after his return from Italy,
Mr. Fawkes of Farnley opened an exhibition of all the water-colours
he possessed at his house in Grosvenor Place. The first
two rooms contained drawings by Havell, Robson, Hedphy, Hills,
Prout, Varley, Fielding, de Wint and others; the third room was
reserved to Turner. The exhibition was a great success, and we
are told that the public had an opportunity of seeing Turner
'moving about the rooms, the principal figure in his own triumph.'
A contemporary critic seems, however, to have made up his mind
that Turner's visit, to Italy had done him temporarily no good. In
the <i>Annals of the Fine Arts</i>, of the year 1820, appeared the following
criticism of Turner's works in the exhibition held at Mr. Fawkes's
house in Grosvenor Place, which must have included some of the
Italian drawings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'Turner appears here in his original splendour and to
his greatest advantage. Those who only know the artist
of late and from his academical works will hardly believe
the grandeur, simplicity and beauty that pervade his best
works in this collection.... The earlier works of Turner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
before he visited Rome and those he has done since for
this collection are like works of a different artist. The
former, natural, simple and effective; the latter, artificial,
glaring and affected.'</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Was the water-colour of the 'Church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo,'
made in Rome in 1819, that now hangs, to our delight, in the new
Turner Gallery, one of the drawings shown at the exhibition in
Grosvenor Place? Hardly. For this beautiful drawing is
'natural, simple and effective,' not 'artificial, glaring and
affected.' Turner saw this glowing church with his own eyes.
Although in Italy, he was at home with himself when he painted
this quiet interlude, undisturbed by the Roman art fever that
heated and harassed his imagination.</p>

<p>A simpler simplicity, a purer and more mystical vision of
colour was eventually to come to him; but not yet. For the
next few years the Italianised Turner was to be finding his way,
through the insistent memories of Italy, to the real Turner.</p>

<h4>RETURN FROM ITALY: HE BEGINS TO SIGHT HIS
MYSTICAL VISIONS</h4>


<p>Visitors to the Royal Academy of 1820 saw that the great man
had been in Rome. How like Turner it was to call a picture
'Rome from the Vatican: Raeffaelle, accompanied by La
Fornarina, preparing his pictures for the Decoration of the Loggia.'
He loved to introduce a painter whom he admired into a picture&mdash;Raphael,
Rembrandt, Ruysdael, Van Goyen, Watteau and the
rest. This Raphael-Roman picture was one of Turner's failures,
and like other failures it is no longer exhibited in the National
Collection. What a contrast it is to such an essential Turner as
the atmospheric 'Lancaster Sands' in the Farnley Hall collection,
produced about this time. Another, a later version now in the
Salting Collection at the British Museum, showing the sun setting
behind the Cumberland Hills, and the stage coach, carts and
figures hurrying to escape the rising tide, was engraved for the
<i>England and Wales</i> series and published in 1828.</p>

<p>Here we stand at a halting-place in Turner's career. He has
trained himself; he has fought his rivals, and, perhaps with the
exception of Claude, has beaten them all on their own ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
He has expressed himself in the luminous atmosphere of 'The
Sun Rising Through Vapour'; in the hoar-frost sparkle of 'The
Frosty Morning'; in the cool blues and greys of 'Crossing the
Brook,' and in the splendour of 'Dido Building Carthage.' In
water-colour he has advanced from the formalism of the early
tinted drawings to the restrained beauty of the <i>Southern Coast</i>
and the accomplishment of the <i>Richmondshire</i> series. And he
has been to Italy: his eyes are dazzled. Colour is to be his
master, but after a few years he is to become almost impatient
of local colour and form, and to lose form and local colour in the
radiance of suffused light. He is to paint the aspect, not the object.
I turn once more to the <i>Inventory</i> and under the rubric 1820 dealing
with 'Colour Beginnings,' find this comment by Mr. Finberg:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'As a rule these studies are of a highly abstract character,
<i>i.e.</i>, they deal only with the composition of fundamental
colour masses&mdash;the ground tones, as it were, of a picture,
which in the final result are largely concealed under the
subsequent embroidery of secondary incidents and motives.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In these 'Colour Beginnings' 'projects for designs which may
or may not have been carried out,' Turner seems to be beginning
to sight his mystical visions. The very titles of some are eloquent
'Moonlight Among Ruins,' 'Hulks on Tamar, Twilight,' 'The
Rainbow,' 'Lighthouse against a Stormy Sky.' Eloquent, too,
are three slight water-colours, showing only faint indications of
the difference between sky and land.</p>

<h4>HE THROWS OFF ANOTHER 'NORHAM CASTLE' AND PREPARES
TO STARTLE THE WORLD WITH 'THE BAY OF BAIÆ'</h4>


<p>Turner sent nothing to the Royal Academy of 1821, and in 1822
he exhibited only the unimportant 'What you Will,' a mere
nothing, a memory of some other painter. 'What you Will' was
probably forgotten except by its owner and students of Turner;
but in 1910 it appeared at Christie's and was described by an
influential daily paper as a fine early Turner 'depicting a party
of ladies and gentlemen in a garden near some groups of statuary.'
It realised £1,176, an enormous rise on the price, one hundred
and fifty guineas, which Chantrey gave for 'What you Will.' He
wrote the price on the back of the picture, so that there might
be no mistake. Turner would have been amazed to learn what
the twentieth century thought of this experiment of his in 'figured
landscape.' Perhaps the price it fetched answers a caustic comment
of Hazlitt's: 'Mr. Turner's pictures have not like Claude's
become a sentiment in the heart of Europe; his fame has not
been stamped and rendered sacred by the hand of time. Perhaps
it never will.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>A Sketch-Book of this year is called 'King's Visit to Scotland.'
On leaf 58, <i>à propos</i> of the reception of George IV., is this note in
Turner's handwriting: 'Custom House Key. The Authorities
in Blue and White Gowns. Red Flags and Gold.' According
to Ruskin's endorsement on the wrapper Turner went to Edinburgh
by sea.</p>

<p>In the 'Medway' Sketch-Book of the previous year on a
drawing of 'Scenes on Medway' are these notes on Clouds in
his own handwriting:&mdash;'Cold,' 'Warm,' 'Yellow Clouds,' 'Rain
with ... Colour along its edge,' 'Rain in Shade.'</p>

<p>No labour either with pen or pencil was too arduous to hinder
him from noting down his impressions of the effects of nature
from hour to hour and day to day. And always every year
there is some work that starts out and affects us by its beauty.
With this year I associate the imposing 'Norham Castle'
in the National Collection engraved for <i>River Scenery</i> in 1824.
The tyranny of the foreground still holds him&mdash;cows, boats,
shed, outbuildings; but this foreground is less insistent than
usual. How beautiful is the blue-grey ruin rising up against the
pale sunset sky; how limpid is the water, with its reflection of
castle and sail rippling on the quiet surface.</p>

<p>This 'Norham Castle' is one of his 'delight pictures,' but
the more arduous work of the Wizard in 1822 was meditating
upon and painting the 'Bay of Baiæ,' with which he proposed
to startle the world at the next Royal Academy exhibition.</p>

<h4>'THE BAY OF BAIÆ': A CRITIC IS CRITICAL, AND A PAINTER
IS ENTHUSIASTIC</h4>


<p>'Waft me to sunny Baiæ's shore' wrote Turner in the <i>Fallacies
of Hope</i>, one of the simple lines, a line that it was quite
permissible to print in the catalogue of the Academy of 1823
against his much discussed, much criticised, and much loved
'Bay of Baiæ.' The picture indeed wafts us to Baiæ, one
of the most beautiful spots in Italy, and we are content with its
beauty if we neglect the pines, their heavy shadows, and the
figures of Apollo and the Cumæan Sibyl posing in the shade.
But could anything be lovelier than the blue sea rippling on the
yellow sand, the subtle hills and the fairy building, a kind of
Claude 'Enchanted Castle' that has passed into a golden dream.</p>

<p>Turner, as I have said before, has his admirers and detractors,
and those who adore part of his achievement and are
critical of the rest; few, if any, admire him all in all. Let me
here quote two authorities on 'The Bay of Baiæ'&mdash;Mr. Finberg,
a critic who has devoted years of his life to Turner, and
Mr. Wyllie, a painter who has written an admirable book on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
master. The reader can decide which form of criticism or commentary
he prefers: the cold objectivity of the critic or the
glowing subjectivity of the painter. Here is Mr. Finberg on
'The Bay of Baiæ,' extracted from the admirable Extra Number
of <i>The Studio</i> on the 'Water Colours of Turner':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It is conceded on all hands that Turner's artistic
work went all to pieces as a result of his Italian experiences.
"The Bay of Baiæ" contains faults altogether
new in his completed works. Even the feeblest of his
earlier works had been animated by some central idea
or emotion to which all the parts were subordinated,
and which infused into them whatever of life or significance
they possessed. In "The Bay of Baiæ" the artist
has an unusual quantity of material on his hands, but
he can neither find nor invent a pictorial idea to give
coherence to his disconnected observations. The picture
is made up of bits of visual experiences elaborately
dovetailed into one another but which absolutely
refuse to combine into any kind of conceptional
unity.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is Mr. Wyllie on 'that wonderful work' 'The Bay
of Baiæ':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'Only eight years before, the "Crossing the Brook"
was painted in little more than black, brown, and palest
blue, and now Turner has thrown aside the inky shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
as cold, grey skies and has burst out a perfect blaze
of splendid colour. Years ago when I was a student
at the old Academy schools in Trafalgar Square I used
to stroll out at the luncheon hour or after closing time,
to have a look at the Old Masters in the National Gallery
next door. Somehow my feet always seemed to carry
me to this my favourite picture at that time.</p>

</div>


<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 2em;">'I think the blue sea breaking gently on the sandy
shore is one of the most perfect of Turner's visions of
Italy. The little jetty, the fishing boats, the castle, and
the volcanic hill thickly wooded and piled ridge beyond
ridge as they pale into the haze are all most splendidly
painted; the ruins half hidden in vines and long trailing
creepers are well done and take their places in the
scheme. There are thin rich glazes and strong yellows
in the foreground and two very conventional stone pines,
which throw a mos unnatural dark shadow right across
the foreground. The Sibyl holding up the cryptic handful
of sand to Apollo as a request for many years of life
is painted quite carelessly; indeed one would almost
fancy that the whole of the near objects were formed up
in that rich, juicy fashion merely to drive back the delicate
middle distance and enhance its beauty. There is no
doubt that it does produce that effect, for if you shut out
that part of the composition with your hand the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the picture suffers though the foreground is nothing by itself.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner's contemporaries made the usual remark that the
real locality had been rather freely treated, or, as Thornbury
puts it, half the scene was sheer invention. As a matter of fact
'Baiæ' is more accurate, from a topographical point of view,
than most of Turner's pictures. Jones wrote across the frame
with a piece of chalk the words '<i>Splendide Mendaæ.</i>' Turner
laughed; he did not even take the trouble to rub out the chalk.
For years the marks remained on the frame.</p>

<p>Here is a pen picture of Turner at this time. David
Roberts, who became one of Turner's most intimate friends,
decribes how he first met him at a meeting of the Artists'
Benevolent Fund, one of Turner's pet schemes which he helped
to found and to carry out. It was characteristic of Turner that
he was in favour of hoarding its funds and distributing but a
small sum each year in charity.</p>

<p>Of this meeting of the Artists's Benevolent Fund at the
Crown and Anchor in the Strand, Roberts wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Being seated round a table covered with green baize&mdash;of
course with the exception of my friend whom I
accompainied, John Wilson, all to me were strangers&mdash;a
little square built man came in, to whom all paid respect;
the business having begun, he joined in the conversation,
and made some weak attempts at wit&mdash;at least I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
so, for no one seemed to laugh at his jokes but himself!
So I asked who this very facetious little man was, and
my astonishment on being told that it was the 'Great
Turner' almost, without meaning a pun, turned my head.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner was not the first great man, and he will not be the
last little man, at whose jokes no one laughs but himself.</p>

<p class="center">1824: AGED FORTY-NINE</p>

<h4>A GLANCE AT SOME OF 'THE RIVERS OF ENGLAND' AND
'HARBOURS OF ENGLAND' WATER-COLOURS</h4>


<p>In 1824 the British National Gallery was founded, and it was
decided by the Committee, which included Sir Robert Peel and
Lord Harding, to buy two of Turner's pictures, for presentation
to the Gallery. The works chosen were 'Dido Building Carthage'
and' The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire.' Five thousand
pounds were to be offered for the two. A memorial was drawn
up, and Griffiths, Turner's old friend, was instructed to present
it to the painter.</p>

<p>Turner, we are told by Thornbury,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'was deeply moved, even to tears, for he was capable of intense
feeling. He expressed his pride and delight at such a
noble offer from such men. But his eye caught the word
"Carthage" in the memorial, and he exclaimed sternly:
"No, no, they shall not have it"; and upon Griffiths
turning to go, he called out after him: "Oh, Griffiths!
make my compliments to the memorialists, and tell them
'Carthage' may some day become the property of the
nation."'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>After this interview, it is said that he went about muttering
to himself&mdash;'A great triumph! A great triumph!'</p>

<p>In this year he is apparently fumbling towards lithography.
In the 'Brighton and Arundel' Sketch-Book is the following
note in his own handwriting in pencil:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Lithography&mdash;the soap is ... dissolved by the aqua
fortis, being saturated to the utmost by pieces of Lith
stone, then diluted with water.</p>

<p>'Silicated potash makes gum a white flakey insoluable
process (?).'</p></blockquote>

<p>He had not forgotten his old rivals and masters, as on
another page, written against 'Views on Coast,' are these two
words followed by a note of interrogation&mdash;'Claude Morning (?).'</p>

<p>On the 'Academy Auditing' Sketch-Book, Ruskin has made
this curious endorsement: 'Kept as evidence of the failure of
mind only.' This Sketch-Book is devoted mainly to figures,
probably Academy finance; but Turner soon tires of sums,
and turns to matters more congenial&mdash;to sketches of a Sleeping
Figure, a Running Figure, Nymph with Children, Satyrs at
Play, and A Falling Figure, against which he has scrawled
the words&mdash;'Fall of Satan?' On the wrapper of the 'Paris,
Seine and Dieppe' Sketch-Book, Ruskin wrote, 'Containing
studies for, I believe, his own house and furniture.' Having
done his duty by these domestic details, Turner treats himself
to a sketch of a Vessel Sailing, to a design for a Classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Composition, to a Boat with Figures, Cows, etc. And on a later
page is this information, written upon a sketch of the back view
of a man with a fishing-rod:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Provide yourself with plenty of gentles in the ...
corner of your jacket pocket. If the aforesaid be old,
so much the better because they [the maggots] will work
through the same cleaning themselves the while. Wade
up to an inclination [?] of 45 or thereabouts in the stream
and you are sure to have fish before and behind.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner was never particularly careful about his attire, but
to allow maggots to clean themselves by working through the
jacket pocket is more than most fishermen would allow.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner did not exhibit at the Royal Academy this year. He
was busy with <i>The Rivers of England</i>, also called <i>River
Scenery</i> and its companion, <i>The Ports of England</i>, afterwards
re-published as <i>The Harbours of England</i>, all of which
were engraved in mezzotint. These beautiful water-colours have
suffered from exposure through many years at the National
Gallery. <i>The Rivers of England</i> were published between 1823
and 1827, and the <i>Ports</i> between 1826 and 1828. The latter
series ended abruptly: some of them were never issued.</p>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Many of us have happy, very happy, memories of days spent
among the Turner water-colours in the National Gallery, where
they seemed more at home in those little rooms on the ground
floor than in their august abode at Millbank. It was an experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to turn (with 'Calais Pier' and the other dark pictures fresh
in the mind) to such lyrical moments as the four sketches of
'Evening at Petworth Park,' to such wonders as 'Ehrenbreitstein,'
'Bellinzona,' 'The Bridge on Moselle at Coblenz,' and the
'Rigi from Lucerne.' But I am again anticipating.</p>

<p>In <i>The Harbours of England</i>, the handling is still a little hard,
and he does not always escape from the thrall of convention; but
there is beauty in the white towers of 'Dover Castle,' rising up from
the golden sward; in the rainbow arching over 'The Medway';
in the splendid theatricality of 'North Shields,' with a huge
white moon riding in an excited blue sky, and in the golden loveliness
of 'Scarborough Castle.'</p>

<p>In 'Totnes on the Dart,' in <i>The Rivers of England</i>, he has
almost discarded the foreground muddle and allows himself merely
one boat, and a group of water birds. Magnificent, overpowering,
is the rainbow cutting the picture in 'Arundel Castle.'
What a glory of space he shows in 'Arundel Park,' and what a
tumult of distant rain in 'More Park.' The ruins of 'Kirkstall
Abbey' have a foreground of red, brown and white cattle, as
decorative as a Brueghel. One of the simplest and the most
beautiful of them all is 'Brougham Castle': the ruin rises from
the meadow against a threatening grey-blue sky, cut at the left
by a rainbow; the trees are well observed and simply stated,
and very attractive is the foreground water with the streaming
red and yellow reflections of the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>At Cooke's Gallery, he exhibited a water-colour of Hastings,
showing the fish-market on the beach. Perhaps this formal
'Hastings' was the parent of that most lovely Hastings, one
of the 'unfinished' oils, the Hastings with the red sail, and the
flecks of gold and red in the sky.</p>

<h4>A SOMEWHAT BARREN YEAR COMMENTED ON IN A BITTER
LAMENT BY RUSKIN</h4>


<p>A somewhat barren year for Turner as regards exhibited work.
One picture only was shown, 'The Harbour of Dieppe,' which the
present generation saw at the Old Masters Exhibition of 1910, a
flayed and not very interesting picture.</p>

<p>The 'Thames' Sketch-Book of 1825 opens with some calculations
as to 'the House, Taxes, etc.,' and later there is a water-colour
of a Barge with the following in his handwriting: 'Tarpaulin
in the light green.' In the 'Mortlake and Pulborough'
Sketch-Book on a drawing of Three Views of a River are these
notes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Children yoked to twig cart,' 'Sheep,' 'River,' 'Park
Monsel' (or 'Mount,') 'Stoten or Storton.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In the 'Holland' Sketch-Book are eleven successive drawings
of Cliffs, twenty-five of Scenes on Coast, thirty-five of Shipping,
and twenty of Views on the River. This Book also contains a
sketch of Terburg's 'Visit of Parents' with this comment:
'Green drapery, beautiful Satin,' and the following against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
drawing of a Bridge: 'The whole of the Bridge in shadow, Water,
Blue-grey. 10 o'clock&mdash;at five sunrise.' Here, finally, is a scene
that he may have intended to use as a foreground written on
a drawing of a Market-place:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Mountebank selling Eau-de-Cologne, beating a drum,'
'Man trying on Boots, all on the ground,' 'Bird Cages,'
'Pots,' 'Pans,' etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this year his friend and patron Mr. Fawkes of Farnley died.
Turner was much affected and would never visit the house again.
His friendship with the son, Hawkesworth Fawkes, continued to
the end of his life, to January 31st, 1851, under which date
there is a letter to 'dear Hawkesworth' extant.</p>

<p>Ruskin considered that about 1825 a grievous metamorphosis
took place in Turner, that his work became 'partly satirical,
partly reckless, and partly&mdash;and in its greatest and noblest
features&mdash;tragic'&mdash;a bitter lament.</p>

<p>Well, he was yet to produce such a sane and magnificent work
as 'The Burial of Wilkie,' the antithesis of satire, recklessness, and
tragedy; he was yet to awaken to the vision of 'Rain, Steam, and
Speed' which Mallarmé seeing, said, 'Turner is the greatest
painter that has ever lived.' He was yet to will the later water-colours.</p>

<h4>ANOTHER UNIMPORTANT YEAR, IN WHICH HE LEAVES
TWICKENHAM</h4>


<p>Another unimportant year as regards the exhibition of pictures.
It would almost seem as if Turner were reserving himself, pondering
over his Italian experiences; or it may have been that his time
was broken into by the trouble of leaving Twickenham.</p>

<p>He had taken Sandycombe for 'Dad'; he gave it up for the
sake of 'Dad,' who was always catching cold while working in the
garden. 'Without,' says Monkhouse, 'the pleasant and wholesome
neighbourhood of the Trimmers, with no home but the
gloomy, dirty, disreputable Queen Anne Street, he became more
solitary, more self-absorbed or absorbed in his art (much the same
thing with him), and lived only to follow unrestrained wherever his
wayward genius led him, and to amass money for which he could
find no use.'</p>

<p>About this time, too, he added to his troubles by another
quarrel with Cooke the engraver, which prevented a proposed continuation
of <i>The Southern Coast</i> series begun in 1814. Cooke's
long letter is extant, and Turner's most ardent admirers must admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that he shows badly in the dispute. To set against his treatment of
Cooke there is his gruff kindness to Lawrence <i>à propos</i> of his picture
of this year called 'Cologne, the Arrival of a Packet Boat, Evening.'
This sea-piece, which had a brilliant sky, was hung between
two portraits by Lawrence. Being painted in a low key, they
suffered from the juxtaposition. 'Sir Thomas was in despair,'
whereupon Turner took some water-colour lamp black and went
all over his sky: 'Why, Turner, what have you done to your
picture?' asked a friend, who had seen it before the coat of lamp-black.
'Oh! it's all right,' said Turner, 'it will all wash off after
the close of the exhibition.'</p>

<p>The <i>Inventory</i> shows that Turner was abroad this year
wandering mainly by the Meuse, Moselle, and Rhine. On one
of the pages containing 'Various Views' Ruskin has the following
note: 'It has seven subjects from Andernach on the Rhine,
showing stormy sunsets and drifts of cloud all completely designed;
the best, that on the left in the second row from the bottom, only
measures one inch and a half in length by three-quarters of an
inch in height.'</p>

<p>A 'View of Dieppe Harbour' in the 'Meuse-Moselle' Sketch-Book
is one of twenty coloured sketches found in a parcel with the
following endorsement in Ruskin's handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'There are one or two in this parcel that some people
might like; I consider them all done in some careless or sickly
state of mind, and have therefore put all aside, except one.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Turner! It is hard to have the work of one's bad days
as well as of one's good days passed before the critical eyes of a
temperamental genius who also had his bad and his good days.
Ruskin was always either hot or cold&mdash;never tepid. I dip at
random into his pages and find this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In the modern French School, all the colour is taken out
of Nature, and only the mud left. By Turner, all the mud
is taken out of Nature, and only the colour left.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Great praise for Turner, but grossly unfair to the 'modern
French School.'</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS THE SEA IN THE OPEN, AND SOME THAMES-SIDE
PICTURES</h4>


<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">In this year Turner is magnificently himself again. His works
show an extraordinary variety, ranging from the peaceful and unambitious
twin pictures of 'Mortlake Terrace,' one on a Summer
Morning, the other on a Summer Evening, to the ambitious and
extravagant 'Rembrandt's Daughter,' wherein the painter pitted
himself against the great Dutchman; but the most welcome work
of Turner at this period, and probably that which gave him the
greatest pleasure, arose from his sojourn at East Cowes Castle
with J. Nash, the architect of the Quadrant, Regent Street, for
whom he painted two yachting pictures with East Cowes Castle
in the background.</p>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We can see the beginnings of his magnificent series of yachting
pictures in the Sketch-Books of this year, particularly in those
labelled 'East Cowes Castle' and 'Yachts.' These studies resulted
in the two pictures of East Cowes Castle, exhibited in 1828,
one of which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum&mdash;gold in
the sky, gold in the foreground, and the golden sun in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of the picture. I for one prefer the studies to the pictures&mdash;brisk,
impulsive atmospheric works, a delight to the eye. These
nine studies, which include the vivid and amusing 'Between
Decks,' are now in the Turner Gallery at Millbank. They were
among the 'unfinished' works exhibited for the first time in 1906.
A note to the official catalogue states that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'These nine pictures were painted on two pieces of
canvas measuring 3 feet by 4 feet. Nos. 1993, 1995, 1996,
2000, 2001 on one piece, and Nos. 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999
on the other. Mr. Finberg has communicated a copy of the
following letter, which probably refers to these two canvases;
it is in the possession of C. Mallord Turner, Esq.,
who has kindly consented to allow it to be published.</p>

<p class="right"><i>'"Sunday.</i></p>

<p>'"I wrote yesterday to Mr. Newman to get a canvas
ready&mdash;6 feet by 4 feet. I wish you to call and ask if he has
it by him and if he gets it done by Middleton in St. Martin's
Lane, or at home. If by Middleton, then let two be sent;
if he does it at home, then he will be some time about it,
and then tell him if he has by him a whole length canvas
to send it instead of preparing the 6 feet 4 canvas. If he
has not then go to Middleton, and if he has one, a whole
length canvas, let him send it me immediately. I want the
canvas only I don't want the stretching-frame made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
town if Middleton or Newman has the canvas ready done,
and if a whole length, let either send it down to me<br/>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">at J. Nash, Esq.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">East Cowes Castle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Isle of Wight.<br /></span></p>

<p>If they are both ready send them together rolled up
on a small roller and put the linen things I wrote for on
the outside.</p>

<p>"I want some scarlet lake and Dark Lake and Burnt
Umber in powder from Newman's, one ounce each.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner is now painting the sea in the open air, not in a studio
as in the 'Calais Pier' days. The boats in the two pictures of
'Yacht Racing in the Solent' are sailing in broken water, their
canvases lit and flecked by sunlight. In No. 2 may be seen the
guard-ship moored under the cliffs upon which East Cowes Castle
stands. Each of these fresh and direct impressions of nature is
a small picture, one measuring 1 foot 5 1/2 inches by 2 feet 4 1/2 inches,
the other 1 foot 6 inches by 2 feet. In 'Shipping at Cowes' No. 1,
he has chosen a still moment. It is the morning of the Regatta;
the sun is in the position where Turner loved to place it, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
centre of the sky; the boats are at their moorings and we see only
a few sailors preparing for the day's work. This small picture was
probably a sketch for the 'Regatta at Cowes,' exhibited at the
Royal Academy in 1828.</p>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">I never look at 'Between Decks' with the fore-shortened gun
pointing at the blue sea, with the ungainly figures of sailors and
marines accompanied by their wives and sweethearts, making such
strong blobs of colour, but I think of a note by Mr. Finberg in
one of the Sketch-Books of a few years forward prefacing
some Turnerian studies which have been called 'Tone Preparations.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'A number of these pages have been prepared with
smudges of red and black water-colour, the colour being
then dabbed and rubbed, with the object apparently of
producing suggestions of figures, groups, etc. In some
cases these suggestions have been further determined by
pencil work.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner was always careless with the figure. The red and gold
sailors and their sweethearts are little more than suggestions of
colour. The eye sees what it wants to see and he saw this vivid
scene on the mess deck in the mass. There is more detail in
'Rembrandt's Daughter,' which was lent from Farnley Hall
to the 'Fair Women Exhibition' of 1910. How Turner would
have chuckled if he could have known that this work would be
chosen to adorn a gallery devoted to types of Fair Women. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
cared little about making Rembrandt's daughter fair. The
idea in his mind was how he could best adapt and improve
Rembrandt's 'Potiphar's Wife' and beat the Dutchman in the
undertaking.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">And how he would have chuckled if he could have foreseen that
his 'Mortlake Summer Morning,' which he painted in 1826, would
be sold in 1908 for twelve thousand six hundred guineas. The
companion picture' Mortlake Terrace Summer Evening' was
exhibited in 1827. It is said that Turner, thinking that a dark
object was needed in the foreground, cut out a dog in black paper
and pasted it on to try the effect. Another version of the story
states that the black dog was affixed to the canvas by a jocular
friend in Turner's absence. The dog remains to this day a dominant
note. Those who saw the 'Mortlake Terrace Summer Morning'
in London before it was sold wondered that Turner did not
oftener confine himself to rendering simply and sympathetically
what his eyes saw and what his heart felt. Burger, the great
French critic, considered that these unaffected, straightforward,
atmospheric riverside pictures deserved a place amongst the
finest things in art. 'Ce qu'on voit des arbres et des pierres est
enveloppé et dévoré par la lumière; tout semble être la lumière
même et jeter aussi des rayons et des étincelles. Claude le suprême
illuminateur n'a jamais rien fait d'aussi prodigieux.'</p>

<p>These canvases, representing the Thames-side seat of William
Moffatt, used to be known as 'Mortlake Summer Morning' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
'Barnes Terrace Summer Evening.' It is a matter of regret that
they are not in the Turner Gallery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">In this year the issue began, and continued until 1838, of what
was to have been his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <i>Picturesque Views in
England and Wales.</i> Says Mr. Rawlinson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In this ill-fated work, which was from first to last commercially
a failure, he proposed to depict every feature of
English and Welsh scenery&mdash;cathedral cities, country towns,
ancient castles, ruined abbeys, rivers, mountains, moors,
lakes, and sea-coast; every hour of day&mdash;dawn, midday,
sunset, twilight, moonlight; every kind of weather and
atmosphere. The hundred or more drawings which he
made for the work are mostly elaborately finished and of
high character. Some are perhaps over-elaborated; in
some the figures are carelessly and at times disagreeably
drawn; but for imaginative, poetical treatment, masterly
composition, and exquisite colour the best are unsurpassed.
I have ventured to say elsewhere that in my opinion
there are at least a dozen drawings in the <i>England and
Wales</i> series any one of which would alone have been
sufficient to have placed its author in the highest rank of
landscape art.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The 'Launceston' belonging to Mr. Schwann is certainly an
imposing vision of height and grandeur; all the more imposing
by reason of the tiny figure on horseback in the foreground. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
who know Launceston well have never seen the castle rising
sky-high as Turner saw it so magnificently in his mind's eye.
Neither shall I ever see 'Barnard Castle' as seen by Turner,
looking up the Tees towards the castle, in the sketch he made
for the <i>England and Wales</i> water-colour, a poet's vision of
opalescent colour floating in atmosphere.</p>

<h4>THE YEAR WHEN CONSTABLE DESCRIBED TURNER'S VISIONS
AS 'GOLDEN, GLORIOUS, AND BEAUTIFUL'</h4>


<p>In 1828 Turner was again in Rome. 'The foreign artists,' says
Thornbury, 'who went to see his pictures could make nothing
of them. Turner's economy and ingenuity were apparent in
his mode of framing those pictures. He nailed a rope round
the edges of each and painted it with yellow ochre in tempera.'</p>

<p>The <i>Inventory</i> shows his travels of this year and the next&mdash;'Orléans
to Marseilles'; 'Lyons to Marseilles'; 'Marseilles
to Genoa'; 'Coast of Genoa'; 'Genoa and Florence '; and
then the 'Roman and French' Sketch-Book. On page 26 of the
'Florence to Orvieto' Sketch-Book he wrote this as if the event
had significance: 'Thursday Orvieto.'</p>

<p>One day he made Turnerian poetry:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Farewell a second time the Land of all bliss<br />
That cradled liberty could wish and hope<br />
Ere the fell Saxon and Norman band<br />
Flouted her ... on the shore<br />
Why go then? No gentle traveller<br />
Cross thy path save the ...<br />
The yellow, winding Tiber,' etc.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>From Rome he wrote several letters. Here is the beginning
of one to George Jones, R.A., showing the manner of Turner's
correspondence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, <i>October 3th</i>, 1828.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>,&mdash;Two months nearly in getting to this
<i>terra pictura and at work</i>; but the length of time is my own
fault. I must see the South of France, which almost
knocked me up, the heat was so intense, particularly at
Nismes and Avignon; and until I got a plunge into the
sea at Marseilles I felt so weak that nothing but the
change of scene kept me onwards to my distant point.
Genoa and all the sea-coast from Nice to Spezzia is
remarkably rugged and fine; so is Massa. Tell that fat
fellow Chantrey that I did think of him <i>then</i> (but not
the first or the last time), of the thousands he had made
out of those marble craigs which only afforded me a sour
bottle of wine and a sketch; but he deserves everything
which is good though he did give me a fit of the spleen
at Carrara.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is the beginning of a letter to Chantrey:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">'No. 12 <span class="smcap">Piazza Mignanelli</span>,
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, <i>NOV. 6th</i>, 1828.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My Dear Chantrey</span>,&mdash;I intended long before this
(but you will say "Fudge!") to have written; but even
now very little information have I to give you in matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of Art, for I have confined myself to the painting department
at Corso; and having finished <i>one</i> am about the
second, and getting on with Lord E.'s, which I began the
very first touch at Rome; but as the folk here talked that
I would show them <i>not</i>, I finished a small 3 feet four
inches to stop their gabbling. So now to business....'</p></blockquote>

<p>The small 3 feet by 4 was the 'View of Orvieto' exhibited
in 1830, referred to with much affection in the opening chapters
of this book.</p>

<p>The pictures shown by Turner at the Royal Academy this
year evoked from Constable the generous and beautiful appreciation
that I have already quoted. It bears repetition:
'Turner has some golden visions, glorious and beautiful. They
are only visions, but still they are art, and one could live and
die with such pictures.' What were the works that called forth
this tribute of admiration from his great contemporary? They
were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Dido Directing the Equipment of the Fleet, or the
Morning of the Carthaginian Empire.'</p>

<p>'East Cowes Castle, the seat of J. Nash, Esq. The
Regatta beating to windward.'</p>

<p>'East Cowes Castle, the seat of J. Nash, Esq. The
Regatta Starting for their Moorings.'</p>

<p>'Boccaccio relating the Tale of the Bird-cage.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Hardly the finest examples of Turner's golden visions; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Constable found them glorious and beautiful. What did Constable
think of the Turner exhibited next year, that magnificent
riot of the imagination, 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus'?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">It was probably during his second visit to Italy that he made
the slight and lovely 'Sketch of an Italian Town,' now in the
Victoria and Albert Museum. This, like the 'Orvieto,' is essential
Italy. Rarely has the feeling of an Italian hill town been given
with such intimacy of observation, just as it looks, a moment
snatched and recorded, artlessly, but with great art.</p>

<p class="center">1829: AGED FIFTY-FOUR</p>

<h4>THE YEAR OF 'ULYSSES DERIDING POLYPHEMUS'</h4>


<p>Of all Turner's pictures, 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus' makes
the strongest appeal to the popular imagination. Call it scenic,
call it theatrical; say that it is like the transformation scene at
a pantomime; admit that it is all wrong, artistically; that
it is lighted from anywhere and everywhere; concede all its
impossibilities and incongruities, and the 'Ulysses' still remains
a magnificent effort of the imagination, a glory to behold,
from the figure of Phœbus, rising with his horses from the sea,
to the vast Polyphemus, who, not being a mortal and bearing
no resemblance to nineteenth&mdash;century man, is the most convincing
figure that Turner ever painted. How often I visited
the old Turner room at the National Gallery to study this
picture or that, but always finding myself, sooner or later, drawn
to this supreme effort of his imagination.</p>

<p>And now that he had emptied himself of all he knew and all
he had dreamed, of wonder and splendour, came the reaction,
and his humorous contempt of the chatter about this masterpiece,
the wonder of the 1829 exhibition. (Yet nobody bought it.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Thornbury recounts that at a dinner party at which Turner
was present, a lady (she exists to-day, and is still making similar
observations) who had seen the 'Ulysses' said to her neighbour,
Mr. Judkins, 'the clerical artist,'&mdash;'Don't you now think
it is a sweet picture?'</p>

<p>'Turner, glum and shy, opposite, is watching all this. He
sees where the lady's eyes fall after she addresses her whispers
to Mr. Judkins. His little beads of eyes roll and twinkle with
fun and slyness. Across the table he growls:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'"I know what you two are talking about, Judkins&mdash;about
my picture."</p>

<p>'Mr. Judkins suavely waves his glass and acknowledges that
it was. The lady smiled on the great man.</p>

<p>'"And I bet you don't know where I took the subject from;
come now&mdash;bet you don't."</p>

<p>'Judkins blandly replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, from the old poet, of course, Turner; from the
<i>Odyssey</i> of course."</p>

<p>'"No," grunted Turner, bursting into a chuckle; "<i>Odyssey</i>; not
a bit of it. I took it from Tom Dibdin. Don't you know the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
'He ate his mutton, drank his wine.<br />
And then he poked his eye out.'"'<br />
</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">To this year also belongs 'Chichester Canal,' unfinished, a
scene of peace and quiet beauty, and was it this year or the next
that he painted 'The Evening Star,' perhaps in its way one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the most appealing of the 'unfinished' Turners? How beautiful,
how perfectly satisfying it would be if only the figure of the
Shrimper and the dancing dog had been omitted. Truly a contrast
to the splendour of the 'Ulysses.' There the sun was rising
in fiery magnificence with the horses of Phoebus dancing up from
the waves, and all that mythical world aglow with colour: here
the sun is setting over the darkening sea, and in the mystical
afterglow gleams the evening star reflected in the water that
ripples gently to that lonely beach.</p>

<p>The authority for ascribing 'The Evening Star' to this period
is to be found in some verses on page 70 of the 'Worcester and
Shrewsbury' Sketch-Book, dated 1829-30, among which the
following fragments have been deciphered:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Where is the star which shone at ... Eve'&mdash;'<br />
The gleaming star of Ever ... '&mdash;<br />
The first pale Star of Eve ere Twilight comes<br />
Struggles with ... '<br />
</p>

<p>These broken lines may be a reference to 'The Evening Star,'
which Mr. Finberg believes was painted about this time. The
Official Catalogue of the Tate Gallery, however, suggests that 'The
Evening Star' may be of the same date as 'The New Moon'
exhibited in 1840.</p>

<p>Two of the other 'unfinished' oils first exhibited in 1906 may
have been painted about this date. Each is similar in composition
to sepia drawings for the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>, the 'Rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Bay with Figures' to the 'Glaucus and Scylla,' which was never
published, and the 'Sunrise, a Castle on a Bay,' to the 'Solitude.'
Turner, of course, gave no title to these suggestions of colour
and atmosphere, and he did not exhibit them. It is only literary
pictures that require titles or descriptions. In one, the sun has
risen behind a mist-shrouded castle on a bay; in the other, sunrays
gleam through a natural arch and light the deep green sea. Greek
galleys are moored in the bay and drawn up on the shore. A
man with outstretched arms may be dimly seen haranguing a
group of sailors. We shall never know when or where he painted
these 'delight pictures.' They call up the spirit of Turner the poet
as the Sketch-Books call up the spirit of Turner the wanderer.</p>

<p>My eyes fall on the following words in his own handwriting,
and for the moment he seems to be present, noting nature, ready
to record some sudden beauty.</p>

<pre style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 10%;">

poet who once 'confessed that he knew much more of his art
than he could explain.'</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS THE 'INTERIOR AT PETWORTH' AND MOURNS
THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER, AND OF SIR THOMAS
LAWRENCE</h4>


<p>Two events mark this year: one sad, the death of his father which
affected his whole after life; the other, an epoch in his development
as artist, the painting of the 'Interior at Petworth.' But
first a few words about other matters.</p>

<p>As I have remarked before, critics are occasionally hard upon
Turner, and sometimes they disagree as to what is fine, and what
is poor in his work. Ruskin labelled a parcel of vignette beginnings
as 'worthless.' Mr. Rawlinson, referring to the numerous
small drawings for vignette illustrations, such as Rogers's <i>Italy</i>
of 1830, and the <i>Poems</i> of 1834, while calling them 'marvels of
execution,' also sees in them 'an unpleasant note,' often a strangely
forced and extravagant colour. Monkhouse considered that it
would be difficult to find in the whole range of his works two
really greater (though so small in size) than the vignettes of 'Alps
at Daybreak,' and 'Datur hora quieti.' Personally, I must confess
to a feeling of lukewarmness in regard to the vignettes. 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Burning of the Houses of Parliament' in Sir Edward Tennant's
collection is tight and harsh in colour compared with the loose
luxuriance of the oil picture.</p>

<p>Some one has said that Turner must on the whole have been
an agreeable person to have in a house&mdash;if the house were big
enough. His visits to Lord Egremont at Petworth were on much
the same footing of intimacy as his visits to Walter Fawkes at
Farnley. Turner had his own private studio at Petworth, and
nobody but Lord Egremont was allowed admission. Even he,
who has been described as 'the rough, cunning, honest old noble-man,'
had to give a peculiar knock on the door before entering.
It is said that Chantrey, when staying at Petworth, imitated Lord
Egremont's peculiar knock, and to Turner's anger entered the room
and saw him at work. This pair of eccentrics, Turner and Egremont,
foregathered happily, and the friendship was severed only
in 1837 by Lord Egremont's death.</p>

<p>The <i>Inventory</i> shows that Turner was at Petworth in 1830.
One of the books contains a sketch for that quaint, attractive
'View in Petworth Park with Tillington Church in the Distance,'
of which an unfinished version is in the National Collection. The
finished oil is in the possession of Lord Leconfield. Most of the
Petworth sketches are in brilliant tints of opaque colour on grey-blue
paper: they resulted one merry day in that startling, delightful
oil picture in the National Collection called 'Interior at
Petworth.' Here is Turner working entirely for his own pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
absolutely indifferent to the forms of things, seeing the havoc
through a mist of sunlight with brilliant rays shining down into
the octagonal sculpture gallery beyond, and reflected through
the Venetian blinds of a window in an alcove to the right. How
the room came to be in this state we do not know. The pugs and
spaniels are evidently enjoying the upturned table and the disarranged
furniture: they caper delightedly over a lady's orange
cloak and feathered bonnet.</p>

<p>I must find room for an extract from a curious and interesting
article upon 'Turner's Path from Nature to Art,' by Professor
Josef Strzygowski, that appeared in the <i>Burlington Magazine.</i>
The learned professor devotes his pen to 'The Frosty Morning'
and the 'Interior at Petworth,' which he considers represent the
two poles: Nature and Art. After remarking that in the days
when the 'Interior at Petworth' was painted no sketch was
regarded as a picture, and so Turner never exhibited the Petworth
'Interior' which 'looks almost like an actual palette, and a
palette, moreover, on which the colours have been thoroughly
daubed together, dashes of colour from the paint-brush and the
palette-knife left as they are, without the least intention of hiding
the technique'&mdash;Professor Strzygowski proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'We do not know what is represented; it seems as if
the picture might just as well hang upside down. And
when we have realised that we are looking upon an interior,
where are the separate shapes expressed? We recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
a large sofa on the right, statues on the left, in front a
little dog. But these three shapes, and all the others, are
so confused, that no one can define their appearance. But
what, then, does the picture really mean? asks the layman.
That is the real discovery of modern times. Sketches in
which an artist gives nothing more than his momentary
impression, <i>i.e.</i>, lets himself go subjectively, leaving the
object, both as regards its meaning and its appearance,
quite in the background, are now admitted to be finished
works of art. The "Interior at Petworth" is not in Mr.
Bell's catalogue. Turner, as we now know, reserved this
work, with so many others, as a private confession of faith.
... For him the shape no longer exists; he sees only light
and colour, and even those transform themselves in a peculiar
way. He does not see a fragment of nature through the
medium of his temperament; but gives us rather, on the
contrary, his own temperament seen through a fragment
of nature. Nature is wholly subordinated to his impetuous
need for self-expression.... The representation, the
"Interior" in itself, has no value for him, except in so far
as its space can be exhibited as the recipient of tone and
colour: the pictorial symbol, as the medium of his need
for expression, is everything to him; the object, the thing
and its shape, are nothing. Thus the cautious painter of
"The Frosty Morning" becomes an artist; thus the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he paints is transformed into spiritual significance, its
shape becomes pictorial symbol; and the technique, which
before was carefully veiled, changes to the boldest impressionism.
... Art like this is for epicures.'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Saner and very beautiful is the water-colour, 'On the Lake at
Petworth, Evening,' in the National Collection, although I am
bound to say that this golden and blue impression is equally
beautiful if you look at it upside down.</p>

<p>In the 'Brighton and Arundel' Sketch-Books (1830), we find
the following in Turner's handwriting on 'A View Looking Out
to Sea with a Sailing Boat':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Beautiful effect of&mdash;&mdash;,' 'Green Top' (<i>i.e.</i> to waves),
'foam grey in shade'&mdash;'reflections of the Boat ... in
water,' 'Reflection of the Boy [?] on the Sail,' 'The warmth
of the Tan Sail,' etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps from these notes he painted the luminous and peaceful
'Old Chain Pier, Brighton,' with the sun low in a yellow haze
gilding the sail, and the reflections of boat and sail in the still
water. Certainly from this 'study' he composed the finished
Brighton picture in the collection of Lord Leconfield. 'A Ship
Aground,' which appears to be a pendant to 'The Old Chain Pier,
Brighton,' is equally luminous and peaceful, in spite of the ground
swell, and the movement of the small craft about the disabled ship.</p>

<p>In the 'Dieppe and Rouen and Paris' Sketch-Book, we find
sketches of three pictures, probably Claudes or Poussins, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
long descriptions in Turner's handwriting, of which the following
are samples:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The trees are grey and dull green and the whole foreground
cold, the earth particularly cold with a few touches
of warm red, but the <i>ground</i> in the picture never protrudes
itself or through the <i>Colours</i>' ... 'The sky is very blue
at the top with some small white clouds with grey shadows,
but at the Hor. [horizon] yellow, so that the distant mountains
are relieved and Blue.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In another Sketch-Book are a number of water-colours on blue
paper, probably connected with <i>The Rivers of France</i> series,
published between 1833 and 1835.</p>

<p>Turner suffered a great blow this year in the death of his father,
for whom he had a deep affection. 'Dad' had been of great use to
his famous son, helping in the preparation of his canvases, attending
to the gallery of unsold pictures, and so forth. When they
were staying at Twickenham, he would travel to town every
morning to open the gallery, riding with the market gardeners,
who conveyed him to London for a glass of gin a day (his own
arrangement). 'Dad' was as careful of money as was his son,
who was wont to chuckle, 'Dad taught me nothing except to save
halfpence.'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Turner was never again the same man after the death of his
father. In this year Sir Thomas Lawrence also died. The Turner
Collection at Millbank contains a sketch of the funeral, looking like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a double-page in an illustrated weekly. The following letter
shows how the death of Lawrence affected him:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">'<span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>,&mdash;I delayed answering yours until the
chance of this finding you in Rome, to give you some account
of the dismal prospect of Academic affairs, and of the last
sad ceremonies paid yesterday to departed talent gone to
that bourn from whence no traveller returns. Alas! only
two short months Sir Thomas followed the coffin of Dawe
to the same place. We then were his pall-bearers. Who
will do the like for me, or when, God only knows how soon!
However, it is something to feel that gifted talent can be
acknowledged by the many who yesterday waded up to
their knees in snow and muck to see the funeral pomp
swelled up by the carriages of the great, <i>without the persons
themselves.</i>'</p></blockquote>

<p>Turner's father was buried in the parish church of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden, where the painter had been baptized. The plain
epitaph was written by Turner; it bears no scriptural text.</p>

<h4>HE TURNS HIS 'MAGIC LIMELIGHT' ON 'CALIGULA'S PALACE
AND BRIDGE'; VISITS SIR WALTER SCOTT, AND MAKES
HIS WILL</h4>


<p>The Wizard makes a great effort this year, sending no fewer
than six pictures to the Royal Academy, and among them was
the famous 'Caligula's Palace and Bridge, Bay of Baiæ,' with
this quotation from the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'What now remains of all the mighty bridge<br />
Which made the Lucrine lake an inner pool,<br />
Caligula, but massy fragments left<br />
As monuments of doubt and ruined hopes<br />
Yet gleaming in the morning's ray, that tell<br />
How Baiæ's shore was loved in times gone by.'<br />
</p>

<p>In this return to classicism Turner is even more wilful than
usual with nature. Undoubtedly there are two suns present, as
Mr. Wyllie points out, one of them shining straight through the
rents in the palace wall, the other illuminating the boy and girl
sitting on an unsubstantial yellow rock. In fact, 'Turner has
turned his magic limelight on where his fancy prompted him, and
has given us only as much nature as he thought good for us.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanciful and unrealised is 'Watteau Painting,' with the
following quotation from Du Fresnoy's <i>Art of Painting.</i></p>

<p>
'White, when it shines with unstained lustre clear,<br />
May bear an object back, or bring it near.'<br />
</p>

<p>Turner was greatly interested in the theory of colour. He
read and annotated Goethe's <i>Theory of Colour</i>, his copy of which
is among the 'Relics' at the Tate Gallery.</p>

<p>The 'Watteau Painting' panel shows that artist, standing in the
centre of the room, making a drawing of a lady and a gentleman
reclining upon a divan. We have a glimpse of Turner's fun in the
sketch he made at Petworth of himself, in the place of Watteau,
painting in a room surrounded by some of the ladies of the
household. I have nothing to say in favour of 'Lord Percy under
Attainder,' except to remark that the dame in yellow is taken
from a picture by Van Dyck at Petworth.</p>

<p>To this year belongs the golden 'Admiral Van Tromp's Barge
at the Entrance of the Texel,' in the Soane Museum. Turner
painted three or four Van Tromp pictures at different periods:
one is in Sir Edward Tennant's collection, another is loaned by
the nation to Sheffield, and a fourth, painted as late as 1844, is
in the Royal Holloway College. All bear slightly different titles,
and all are breezy and golden. Another picture of 1831, a
fine, wild sea-piece, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The
title is an apt description: 'Life Boat and Manby Apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
going off to a Stranded Vessel making Signals (Blue Lights) of
Distress.' The 'Sketch of Cochem on the Moselle' needs no
description. It is a mere impression of light and movement, a
quick record, unfinished if you like, yet quite finished in its
statement of essential beauty.</p>

<p>Turner made a special journey to Scotland this year to make
illustrations for Sir Walter's Scott <i>Poetical and Prose Works.</i>
Turner was the guest of Sir Walter, and together they visited
the most interesting spots on the Tweed and the Border, and in
one of the plates&mdash;the Melrose&mdash;he, Scott and Cadell, small
figures, are shown together, picnicking on a height overlooking
the river and the Abbey.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June he signed his will, to be followed later
by codicils, the vast, complicated will that he brooded over so
long, that produced interminable litigation, with the result
that almost all of his behests were disregarded. The Turner
Gallery at Millbank is a magnificent, if tardy, reparation.</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS 'CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE' AND IS
JOCULAR ON VARNISHING DAY</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'... and now, fair Italy!<br />
Thou art the garden of the world,<br />
Even in thy desert what is like to thee?'<br />
</p>

<p>This, the beginning of an extract from Byron, accompanied his
'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'&mdash;that late golden afternoon, Italy basking
in the heat haze. The stone pine has been mercilessly criticised;
but although that useful tree and the foreground pictures are carelessly
painted, how beautiful is the horse-shoe bend of the placid
river, and the suffused light on ruin, convent, walled town, and
distant hills, illumined from the sun sinking behind the mountains.</p>

<p>There is a story connected with two of his other pictures of
this year, 'Helvoetsluys&mdash;the City of Utrecht, 64 Going to Sea,'
and that impossible work with the unwieldy title illustrating
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego coming forth from the burning
fiery furnace. Turner asked George Jones, R.A., what he
intended to paint for the ensuing exhibition. 'Oh!' said Jones,
'the Fiery Furnace, with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.'
'A good subject,' said Turner, 'I'll do it also.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>In the exhibition Jones's picture of 'The Fiery Furnace'
was placed opposite to Turner's grey 'Helvoetsluys,' and next
to Constable's 'The Opening of Waterloo Bridge.' Turner,
who had been watching Constable brightening the flags and
decorations of his city barges with vermilion and lake, realised
that the flutter of colour was making his own grey picture look
insignificant. Suddenly he put a round daub of red lead, somewhat
bigger than a shilling, on his grey sea, and departed without
a word. The intensity of the red lead caused even the vermilion
and lake of Constable to look weak.</p>

<p>When Constable saw the red lead he said&mdash;'Turner has been
here and fired off a gun.' 'A coal,' cried Cooper, 'has bounced
across the room from Jones's "Fiery Furnace," and set fire to
Turner's sea.' The great man did not visit the room for a day
and a half; then, in the last moments that were allowed for
painting, he glazed the scarlet seal he had put on his picture, and
shaped it into a buoy.</p>

<p>Constable, according to Thornbury, was secretly very severe
on Turner's pictures, which does not tally with his spoken and
written enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Little did Constable, or any one else, realise the work that
Turner was yet to do. In the following year, at the age of fifty-eight,
he exhibited his first Venetian picture&mdash;Venice&mdash;that was
to absorb and haunt him, and inspire some of the most lovely
visions of his ageing eyes.</p>

<h4>HE PAINTS HIS FIRST 'VENICE' PICTURE AND RE-PURCHASES
SOME OF HIS OWN DRAWINGS AT AUCTION</h4>


<p>Venice, 'the last home of his imagination,' if we exclude the mountains
of Switzerland, and the Thames of England, where he found
his final solace, begins to inspire his brush, but not the visionary
Venice that he was to evolve later, visions of colour and light which
seem to be floating from sight even as we look at them. First
the spade work&mdash;that was Turner's way. As he began painting
the sea from the pictures of Van de Velde, so he began painting
Venice from the pictures of Canaletto, and in this first interpretation,
or rather illustration, of Venice, he introduced, in his quaint, admiring
way, his hero for the moment, at work. 'The Bridge of
Sighs, Ducal Palace and Custom House, Canaletto Painting,' is a
sober topographical performance compared with his later pictures
of the bride of the Adriatic. Indeed the quotation from Rogers's
<i>Italy</i> gives more of a lilt to the imagination than the picture:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'There is a glorious city in the sea,<br />
The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets,<br />
Ebbing and flowing; and the salt sea-weed<br />
Clings to the marble of her palaces.'<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>No fewer than twenty-seven pictures of Venice by Turner have
been catalogued.</p>

<p>Between 1833 and 1835 were published the beautiful series of
<i>The Rivers of France</i> known as <i>Turner's Annual Tour.</i> The
letterpress was by Leitch Ritchie, but they did not travel together
'as their tastes were dissimilar.' Ritchie gives the following
description of the artist's methods:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'His exaggerations, when it suited his purpose, were
wonderful; lifting up, for instance, by two or three stories,
the steeple, or rather the stunted cone of a village church.
I never failed to roast him on the habit. He took my remarks
in very good part, sometimes indeed in great glee,
never attempting to defend himself otherwise than by
rolling back the war into the enemy's camp. In my account
of the famous Gilles de Retz, I had attempted to identify
that prototype of "Blue Beard" with the hero of the
nursery story, by absurdly insisting that his beard was so
intensely black that it seemed to have a shade of blue.
This tickled the great painter hugely; and his only reply
to my bantering was, his little sharp eyes glistening the
while, "Blue Beard! Blue Beard! Black Beard!"'</p></blockquote>

<p>There were sixty drawings in this wonderful series, most of
which are in the Turner Gallery. He did not sell these water-colours,
preferring to lend them to the publishers for engraving
purposes for which he charged from five to seven guineas each.
Ruskin tells how one day Turner brought to him the sixty drawings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
for <i>The Rivers of France</i> rolled in dirty brown paper, offering
them for twenty-five guineas each. Ruskin, to his grief, could not
persuade his father to spend the money. In later years he had to
pay a thousand pounds for the seventeen which he gave to Oxford.
To look through this series is to be again impressed by the range
of Turner's genius. Which is the most beautiful? I know not.
Sometimes one, sometimes another&mdash;the blue mystery of 'The
Light Towers of Hève,' the huddled splendour of 'Sunset in the
Port of Havre,' the wild translucent sweep of the tidal wave in
'Quellebœuf,' the quiet splendour, infinity on a few inches of
paper, of 'The Seine between Tancarville and Quellebœuf,' the
poetry of 'Caudebec,' the fantasy of 'Jumiéges,' the charm of
'The Post Road from Vernon to Nantes,' the mystery of 'St.
Denis.' Invited to pick one, I should hardly know which to choose.
What a parcel of dreams for Turner to bring to Ruskin rolled in
dirty brown paper. And while Turner the poet was preparing to
realise these dreams, Turner the man was casting his acquisitive
eye on former works of his own that came into the market. When
Dr. Munro died in 1833, Turner attended the sale of his pictures,
and acquired a great many of his own early works; no doubt he
bought others too, as among the doubtful drawings catalogued
at the end of the <i>Inventory</i>, are many by different hands. Turner
informed the auctioneer that some of the drawings attributed
to him were not his. That must have been an interesting
spectacle. For Turner, when he had a grievance, did not conceal
it.</p>

<h4>SOME OLD STORIES AND SOME AGELESS COLOUR STUDIES</h4>


<p>Turner, in his sixtieth year, is on the threshold of the period when
colour and light were more and more to obsess him to the exclusion
of form and detail. In the <i>Inventory</i>, there are books labelled
simply 'Colour Studies,' and among the water-colours connected
with his 'Meuse-Moselle-Rhine' tour are some bearing such suggestive
titles as 'Crimson Ruins,' 'Vermilion Towers,' 'Tower in
Sunbeam,' 'Blue Hills,' 'Ruins with Rainbow.' In the 'Colour
Studies' Sketch-Book there are nearly fifty pages described
merely as 'Colour Sketches'; and on the last page are several
lines of illegible verse. Also, after a sketch of a 'Ruined Castle
on a Rock' a recipe 'said to be an infallible cure for the bite of a
mad dog.'</p>

<p>In the 'Oxford and Bruges' Sketch-Book he breaks into this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'Old Tom, of Christ Church, Oxford. What? is it you
Old Tom that keep this row every night? What? is it
right that <i>you</i> should summon us to bed at nine continually
all the year round? Is it fair that you, Tom, should thus
deal with us every night?'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">With my mind full of the visionary Turner, the dreamer and
the troubled traveller, I am a little impatient of 'The Golden
Bough' of this year; so apparently were the trustees of the
National Gallery, as they banished it to Dublin. As to
'St. Michael's Mount,' now in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
how beautiful would be the pale gold Mount, rising from a pale
gold shore into a grey-blue sky, if the foreground with its fish and
figures, boat and lobster-pots, could be banished. The fine and
whirling spectacle of the 'Fire at Sea,' that looks so well in its
new home at Millbank, was composed, no doubt, from 'The Fire
at Sea' Sketch-Book, which has this endorsement by Ruskin:
'A careless book: the fine ships on fire taken out of it and very
little left.'</p>

<p>He exhibited another Venice subject this year, probably the
Venice about which Thornbury tells a story: how the inevitable
Jones, who was showing a picture with a blue sky in it, tried to
paint his sky brighter, so as to make it outshine Turner's, which
hung alongside. Turner then made his sky still more blue, whereupon
Jones painted out his blue sky altogether and put in a white
one.</p>

<p>'Ah! Jones,' said Turner, 'you've done me now.'</p>

<p>Here may be told once again the story of the encounter
between Gillott the pen manufacturer and Turner, in Thornbury's
own words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>We are told that one day Mr. Gillott, the well-known
manufacturer of Birmingham, sallied forth from his hotel,
determined at any price to obtain admission to the enchanted
house in Queen Anne Street. He was rich, he
was enthusiastic&mdash;he believed strongly in the power of the
golden key to open any door. He arrived at the blistered
dirty door of the house with the black-crusted windows.
He pulled at the bell; the bell answered with a querulous,
melancholy tinkle. There was a long inhospitable pause;
then an old woman with a diseased face looked up from
the area, and presently ascended and tardily opened the
door, keeping the filthy chain up, however, as a precaution.
She snappishly asked Mr. Gillott's business. He told her
in his blandest voice. "Can't let 'e in," was the answer, and
she tried to slam the door. But during the parley the
crafty and determined Dives had put his foot in, and now,
refusing to any longer parley, he pushed past the feeble,
enraged old she-Cerberus, and hurried upstairs to the gallery.
In a moment Turner was out upon him like a spider on
another spider who has invaded his web. Mr. Gillott bowed,
introduced himself, and stated that he had come to buy.
"Don't want to sell," or some such rebuff, was the answer;
but Gillott shut his ears to all Turner's angry vituperations.
"Have you ever seen our Birmingham pictures, Mr.
Turner?" was his only remark.</p>

<p>'"Never 'eard of 'em," said Turner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>'Gillott pulled from his pocket a silvery fragile bundle of
Birmingham bank-notes (about £5000 worth).</p>

<p>'"Mere paper," said Turner, with grim humour, a little
softened, and enjoying the joke.</p>

<p>'"To be bartered for <i>mere</i> canvas," said Gillott, waving
his hand at the "Building of Carthage" and its companions.</p>

<p>'"You're a rum fellow!" said Turner, slowly entering
into negotiations, which ended in Gillott eventually carrying
off in his cab some five thousand pounds' worth of
Turner's pictures.'</p></blockquote>

<p>These old stories, when one has heard them once, are not very
exhilarating, but they all have truth in their well of words. It
is pleasant to turn from them, and merely to repeat the titles of
some of the sketches mentioned before, sounding as beautiful as
they look, and to glance at such a delicate drawing as the 'View
on the Moselle,' and to follow the river feeling for its level
between the flushed hills.</p>

<p>And it is pleasant, too, to know that the time has now come to
consider the loveliest of the 'unfinished' oils, the pictures painted
for his own delight in moments of exhilaration, that were revealed
to the public in 1906. It is probable that the most delicate and
evanescent of them were painted at intervals between this year
and 1838. Unsigned, unnamed, undated, it is impossible to give
them a certain date, and really it does not much matter. Turner
painted them; the nation has them: that is all we need to
know.</p>

<h4>SOME REMARKS ON THE 'UNFINISHED' OILS, AND <i>BLACKWOOD'S</i>
ATTACK ON HIS 'VENICE' PICTURE OF THIS YEAR</h4>


<p>Ruskin, to whom we owe so much, whose prose delights, consoles,
inspires, confuses, bewilders and annoys in turn; who, by his very
enthusiasm for Turner, occasionally ill-judged and unfair to other
painters, is sometimes of disservice to Turner, has nevertheless
constructed an edifice of interpretation, praise and blame that
must last as long as the pictures themselves. Certain of Ruskin's
phrases are unforgettable; one consists of but two words&mdash;'Delight
Drawings,' designed to describe the water-colours Turner
made during the last ten years of his working life; not done for
the engraver or for exhibition, but just for his own pleasure. 'I
look upon them,' said Ruskin, 'as more valuable than his finished
drawings or his oil pictures, because they are the simple record
of his first impressions and first purposes, plans or designs of the
pictures which, if he had had time, he would have made of each
place.'</p>

<p>Since these words were written, we have learnt to esteem even
more highly these 'Delight Drawings,' and to regard them as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
final and highest expressions of Turner's genius. With the inward
eye I see Turner walking about a town with a roll of thin paper in
his pocket, as Ruskin has described, making a few scratches upon
a sheet or two, mere shorthand indications of all he wished to
remember, then at his inn in the evening completing the pencilling
rapidly, and adding 'as much colour as was needed to record his
plan of the picture.'</p>

<p>Thus in the last decade of his life, when he had mastered his
craft, turned away from the works of all other painters to the fair
face of nature, did Turner produce his 'Delight Drawings.'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Equally quickly, happily and impulsively did he produce the
'unfinished' oils. Could there be a better name for these 'water-colours
writ large,' than 'Delight Pictures,' done like the drawings
for his own pleasure, in moments of impulse while he was working
upon exhibition pictures, much as a man, when writing a history
of a county, might break off to record in a hundred words, a 'thing
seen,' something of the present, that had spoken to his heart while
studying the present manners and customs of the county?</p>

<p class="caption">Plate XXVIII. <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> (<i>about</i> 1835) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">It is impossible to date accurately all the 'Delight Pictures,'
a list of which is given in the chapter towards the end of this
book describing the sensation caused by the exhibition of the
'unfinished' oils in 1906. The 'Rocky Bay with Figures,' and the
'Sunrise, a Castle on a Bay,' both founded on sepia drawings for
the <i>Liber</i>, may have been done as early as 1829 or 1830; the 'Yachting'
series certainly belong to 1827; the 'Chain Pier, Brighton,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and the 'Ship Aground' to 1830, and 'The Evening Star' may be
as early as 1829, or as late as 1840. Some, the most delicate and
evanescent, wonders of light, flushes of colour, may have been
painted any time between 1830 and 1840; others, perhaps later,
as 'The Burning of the Ships,' and 'Sunrise and a Sea Monster,'
which probably belong to the 'Whalers' period. It is impossible
to describe them, and as many are reproduced in colour in this
volume, the attempt is hardly necessary. The catalogue of the
Turner Gallery bravely attempts description and elucidation;
but these works were never meant either to be titled or described.
I am content merely to look at the crepuscular beauty of the
nocturne with the evening star; at the deep green sea lighted near
the shore by a gleam of golden sunlight in 'A Rocky Bay with
Classic Figures,' unaware until I am told, that Greek galleys are
moored in the bay and drawn up on the shore, and that a shadow
of a man is haranguing a group of shadowy sailors; at the mist-shrouded
castle behind which the sun is rising&mdash;Turner the mystic,
the initiate in light and colour.</p>

<p>But if these are beautiful, what word can describe the 'Sunrise
with a Boat between Headlands,' the 'Hastings,' and the 'Norham
Castle, Sunrise,' his final vision of the ruin that he had painted again
and again (see Frontispiece). It has now become a mere whisper
of light and colour, a half-uttered murmur of the wonder of sunrise.
Detail has gone; it is flooded in light; the old familiar foreground
has disappeared, leaving only the glory of the sky reflected in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
water with the note of red, the blue rampart, and the haze that is
all colours. What is to be said about 'Sunrise, with a Boat
between Headlands'? I look at it, love it, and easily forget the
useful information given in the catalogue to the effect that a
water-colour similar in composition, once in the collection of the
late Sir James Knowles, is said to be a view on the Lake of Lucerne.
Hastings, too, Turner painted again and again, but never did
he realise so perfectly the atmospheric vision that he once had of
ugly Hastings as in this 'Delight Picture,' with the amber and
golden sails rising to the pale blue sky, the amber sail strong
against the rosy light on the cliffs. And the misty, yellow sunrise
of the 'Bridge and Tower,' with the dreamland viaduct spanning
the dreamland river, is it not beautiful? But when he painted
that stalwart tree to the right, I think Turner's imagination
flagged.</p>

<p>Delight Pictures! Delight Drawings! One of the drawings
rises before me as I write, a late one done a few years before his
death, that exquisite 'Study on the Rhine,' body colour on grey
paper, in the collection of Sir Edward Durning-Lawrence. I have
no words to describe this wonder of misty blue and gold, with the
moon riding in a sky charged with the mystery of essential colour.
We are all, like Ruskin, extravagant at times in speaking and
writing of the finest work of Turner. A man, long dead, a contemporary,
said: 'There are parts of some of them wonderful,
and by God, all other drawings look heavy and vulgar.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>A living man said in my hearing: 'They are the finger of God:
there is no other way to describe them.'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>

<p>I must now take up the story of Turner's exhibited pictures
in 1835, which included 'Line Fishing off Hastings,' now in the
Victoria and Albert Museum; 'Venice from the Porch of Madonna
della Salute,' now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, signed
on a floating plank, the picture which <i>Blackwood</i> attacked; and
two versions of the magnificent 'Burning of the Houses of Lords
and Commons,' one shown at the Royal Academy, the other at
the British Institution. Turner had watched the conflagration
the year before, as the 'Burning of the Houses of Parliament'
Sketch-Book of 1834 tells us. There are also water-colours of this
subject in the National Collection, and at Farnley, and a vignette
in Sir Edward Tennant's collection. As a nocturne the 'Burning
of the Houses of Parliament' is as furious as 'The Evening Star'
is peaceful. Dim boats push out into the lurid light reflected in
the water; other boats linger in the pools and eddies within the
shadow of the bridge; the whole scene is a bustle of colour, from
pale primrose on the bridge in shadow, to the hurry of red and
yellow in the night sky bright with the illumined smoke. The
Royal Academy version was, we are told, almost repainted by
Turner on Varnishing Day. 'He finished it on the walls the last
two days before the gallery was opened to the public'. The
authority is Scarlett Davies, whose letter on the subject I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
already quoted: 'I am told it was good fun to see the great man
whacking away with about fifty stupid apes standing around him,
and I understand that he was cursedly annoyed&mdash;the fools kept
peeping into his colour-box, examining all his brushes and colours.'</p>

<p>Thornbury tells us that Lord Hill, on looking at the picture,
exclaimed: 'What's this? Call this painting? Nothing but
dabs.' But upon retiring and catching its magical effects, he
added: 'Painting! God bless me. So it is.'</p>

<p>In this year the attacks in the press began, heralded by
<i>Blackwood</i>, with a severe criticism of 'Venice from the Porch of
Madonna della Salute.' The writer in <i>Blackwood</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Venice, well I have seen Venice. Venice the magnificent,
glorious, queenly, even in her decay&mdash;with her rich,
coloured buildings, speaking of days gone by, reflected in
the <i>green</i> water. What is Venice in this picture? A
flimsy, whitewashed, meagre assemblage of architecture,
starting off ghostlike into unnatural perspective, as if
frightened at the affected blaze of some dogger vessels (the
only attempt at richness in the picture). The greater part
of the picture is white, disagreeable white, without light or
transparency, and the boats, with their red worsted masts,
are as gewgaw as a child's toy, which he may have cracked
to see what it is made of. As to Venice, nothing can be
more unlike its character.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor old Turner! But this 'Venice' as not a good picture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
John Ruskin, then sixteen years of age, read the article in <i>Blackwood</i>,
read it with indignation, and his brain became a tumult of
thoughts, and, when the attack was continued, he wrote a letter.
Seven years later that letter became a book, the first volume of
<i>Modern Painters.</i></p>

<h4>THE RECEPTION OF 'JULIET AND HER NURSE' PROCLAIMS
THAT TURNER IS BEGINNING TO LOSE FAVOUR WITH THE
PUBLIC</h4>


<p>This year, alas! Turner exhibited 'Juliet and her Nurse,' and
'Mercury and Argus.' How strange it is that the hand that was
painting Delight Drawings and Pictures for pleasure should also
be producing 'Juliet and her Nurse' and 'Mercury and Argus'
for exhibition. Even kindly Time has not brought 'Mercury and
Argus' into favour. Shown at the Japan-British Exhibition of
1910, all a modern critic could say was: 'It is charitable to suppose
that it was hastily produced for purposes of exhibition, with
a carelessness as to technical structure which time has exposed.'
The contemporary attacks on 'Juliet and her Nurse,' following
the severe criticism in <i>Blackwood</i> of the Venice picture, provoked
Ruskin to write the letter, the germ of <i>Modern Painters</i>, mentioned
in the foregoing chapter. This defence by the fiery champion of
seventeen was acknowledged by Turner' with thanks but without
praise,' and he added, 'I never move in these matters.'</p>

<p>During the journey to Italy, which Turner made this year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
with Mr. Munro of Novar, I do not suppose that he ever mentioned
the name of Ruskin. That must have been rather a difficult
journey, as Munro of Novar was suffering from a 'great depression
of spirits'; but the trip seems to have been of benefit to Munro.
He reports that Turner enjoyed himself in his way&mdash;'a sort of honest
Diogenes way '&mdash;and that he was companionable enough if such
teasing questions were avoided as to how he got this or that colour.</p>

<p>Turner never rhapsodised about scenery. His usual morning
question during that journey was, 'Have you got the sponge?'
He was fond of laconic remarks. One of them I shall always
remember. Ruskin, before starting forth on a certain foreign tour,
called upon Turner to bid him good-bye, the ardent youth no doubt
expecting, hoping for, priceless words of counsel; but Turner was
mainly anxious that the young author should not give his parents
cause for anxiety on his travels. 'They will be in such a fidge
about you,' were his parting words.</p>

<h4>'TROUBLES BEGIN TO GATHER ABOUT HIM. NOTHING
WILL GO RIGHT'</h4>


<p>The pictures exhibited in 1837 did not restore Turner to favour.
They included the 'Snowstorm, Avalanche and Inundation,'
described as a 'tumult of cloud, wind and raging torrent in the
gorge,' the sketch for which he had made on his way to Italy with
Munro of Novar; and the 'Departure of Regulus,' which Ruskin
included among the 'nonsense pictures.'</p>

<p>Troubles begin to gather about him. Nothing will go right.
The beautiful <i>England and Wales</i> series had been received with
so little favour that it was decided to discontinue the issue. The
stock was put up for auction, but Turner opened negotiations
and purchased the whole privately for three thousand pounds.
Many of those present were willing to buy portions of the work.
To one of these Turner said: 'So, sir, you were going to buy my
<i>England and Wales</i> to sell cheap, I suppose&mdash;make umbrella
prints of them, eh? But I have taken care of that. No more
of my plates shall be worn to shadows.'</p>

<p>The dealer tried to explain that he wanted only the printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
stock, and Turner seemed to understand, made an appointment,
then forgot all about the matter.</p>

<p>Fighting the world of men, he never wearied in finding his
way about the world of nature, recording his impressions, and
adding with difficulty to his small stock of education. On the
first page of the 'Dresden' Sketch-Book is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'I want to go to Berlin.<br />
Ich will nach Berlin gehen.<br />
I wish to see.<br />
Ich wollte&mdash;sehen, etc.'<br />
</p>

<p>A little later he comes into his own joys again&mdash;twenty-one
pages of 'Buildings,' and sixteen of 'Views on River,' with sketches
of sunsets and rocks, distant coasts and sailing boats&mdash;anything
so long as it was beautiful in light, line or movement.</p>

<p class="center">1838. AGED SIXTY-THREE</p>

<h4>A 'NONSENSE PICTURE' OF 1838 WHICH IN 1878 FETCHED
£5460 AT AUCTION</h4>


<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">From this year onward until after 1845, when his health began
to fail, Turner spent more and more time on the Continent, making
his beloved impressions of the moment, and producing the unrivalled
water-colours of his 'latest phase,' each a 'vision of delight.'
The Sketch-Books of the period are records of foreign travel.
Venice and the Lake of Lucerne were the places of his heart's
choice. I know not how many times he drew the Righi, making the
mountain now dark, now pale, now red, now blue; or how many
times he painted Venice, her churches, her buildings and her water-ways
until in the end the city in the sea became a celestial city in
a dream&mdash;his dream. The exhibited pictures of 1838 are splendid
failures. They included 'Modern Italy' and 'Ancient Italy,' the
latter classed by Ruskin among the 'nonsense pictures.' Here is
the passage: '"Caligula's Bridge," "Temple of Jupiter," "Departure
of Regulus," "Ancient Italy," "Cicero's Villa," and such
others, come they from whose hand they may, I class under the
general head of "nonsense pictures." 'But so strange a creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
is man, so deaf to advice, that this 'Ancient Italy' was sold by
auction in 1878 for £5460. Some prize Turner's failures higher
than the successes of other men.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">'Phryne Going to the Public Bath as Venus&mdash;Demosthenes
taunted by Aeschines,' I have not seen. It is one of the Turners
that were withdrawn from the walls of the National Gallery.
Mr. Wyllie describes this procession of dancing girls, madly throwing
a white Cupid into the air and pirouetting, as woven into a
bewildering maze of light and colour.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Drawing is neglected, and the most audacious expedients
resorted to, increasing the brilliancy and the movement
of the throng. Some of the faces are white with vermilion
shadows. The head of Demosthenes is twisted out
of all likeness to human form. In fact everything is sacrificed
to colour.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Never has Turner been so wilful as he is now at the age of
sixty-three. Think of it&mdash;sixty-three, and wilder, more revolutionary,
more indifferent to convention than a hot-headed youth
of twenty-three. 'He paints white sails or buildings up against
a sunset, which is a thing impossible.' He disregards drawing and
form, and squeezes features 'together into one corner of a face,
slanting diagonally across it like handwriting' ... True.</p>

<p>But the magician conquered, not through these wildnesses,
but in spite of them. Even when most extravagant, there is
enough of the essential Turner to make the picture great. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
dreams were too vast for the poor tools at his command; he
tripped over his tools, he tripped up over nature; but he did what
no other man has ever been able to do. And he could still be
magnificently sane when he painted something that his eyes had
seen, not something that his chaotic fancy had imagined. The
year following the 'Phryne,' he exhibited one of his sanest, and
probably his most popular picture&mdash;'The Fighting Téméraire
Tugged to Her Last Berth to be Broken up,' the last picture of his
'at which no stone was thrown.' And he gave to it a true and
trite tag of poetry, which I take the liberty of writing as prose,
that the curious reader may amuse himself by trying to recast the
line into poetry: 'The flag which braved the battle and the breeze
no longer owns her.' The first nine words may be by some
esteemed poet: none but Turner would have written the last four
words as a line of verse.</p>

<h4>'THE FIGHTING TÉMÉRAIRE,' AND A SEA-PIECE ON A
VISITING-CARD</h4>


<p>A party of the Academy Club were journeying to Greenwich, on
their annual visit, when the steamer passed a tug with an old
battleship in tow.</p>

<p>'There's a fine subject for you, Turner,' said Clarkson Stanfield,
And Turner, who could take a hint from anybody, looked,
chuckled, ruminated, no doubt made a pencil sketch, and the result
was 'The Fighting Téméraire.'</p>

<p>She was launched at Chatham Dockyard in 1798: she had
been the second ship in Nelson's division at the Battle of Trafalgar
in 1805. Sold out of the service at Sheerness in 1838, she was now
being towed to Rotherhithe to be broken up. Her career was
ended, but Turner has made the memory of the old wooden warrior
immortal. 'The Fighting Téméraire' is too well known to be
described. Pages and pages have been written about the picture
with scornful comments that the sun and the mast are in the wrong
places, and I know not what else. The mast, of course, should
not be abaft the funnel; this curious error, or perhaps intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
on Turner's part so that nothing should interfere with
that black note, was corrected by J. T. Willmore, in his
engraving. The 'Téméraire' as popular. No abusive voice,
says Ruskin, was ever raised against it. 'And the feeling
was just, for of all pictures and subjects not visibly involving
human pain, this is, I believe, the most pathetic that was ever
painted.'</p>

<p>An admirer who tried to purchase the 'Téméraire,' had a long
interview with Turner in Queen Anne Street, but the painter could
not be induced to put a price upon the picture, although he offered
to take a commission of the same size at two hundred guineas.
There is the usual Varnishing Day story told about the 'Téméraire.'
Geddes, who had a portrait hung above, realising that his picture
was killed by the dazzle of Turner's sunset, prepared to introduce
a showy carpet into the floor of his portrait. He had laid it in
with a flat, bright tint of vermilion when Turner appeared. 'Oh,
ho! Mr. Geddes,' he cried, and seizing his palette knife loaded on
orange, scarlet and yellow. Returning the next day Turner
found that the bright vermilion ground in Geddes's picture
had been converted into a 'rich, quiet, sober-coloured Turkey
carpet.'</p>

<p>Less popular, because it makes no appeal to pathos or sentiment,
was another exhibit of this year, with another of the
unwieldy titles, 'Ancient Rome, Agrippina Landing with the
Ashes of Germanicus, The Triumphal Bridge and Palace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">If only Agrippina, with the ashes of her husband and the bodies
of her suite were absent, what a lovely vision this would be with
the rosy bridge, the yellow fairy-like building, and the full moon
riding in the evening sky. Yet why ask to have the figures taken
away? They are Turner; it is all Turner, a glorious Turner, still
in the hour of his splendour, and quite careless of the fact that it
was at Brindisium, not Rome, that Agrippina landed. Northcote,
who had a dark subject picture hanging above 'Ancient Rome,'
said, 'You might as well have opened a window under my picture.'
Turner was always opening a window to a poet's land, which, if it has
no earthly habitation, exists, eternally, in that place where all beautiful
things dwell&mdash;the imagination. The Sketch-Books of this
period are as crowded with drawings as the court of Agrippina with
figures. In the 'Venice' Book of 1839 against a water-colour
entitled by Ruskin 'Venice: Sunset sketch with turned edge,' he
has appended this note: 'Preserve this drawing exactly as it is,
as evidence of the way he worked; the turned edge of the paper
painted upon.'</p>

<p>The 'Venetian Fishing Boat' also shows the 'way he worked,'
when working for his own pleasure, not for exhibition&mdash;green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
water, violet hills, rosy buildings held together by the strength
of that tawny sail&mdash;lovely.</p>

<p>On a packet which contained a number of drawings in a
Sketch-Book, now labelled 'Miscellaneous,' Ruskin inscribed the
following: 'Thirty-four pieces of paper, some double. Pencil
Outline. Rubbish; only worth looking at for references. It
contains many late scrawls of German scenery. Studies of
Germany, etc.'</p>

<p>What may have seemed rubbish to Ruskin, pencil scrawls, etc.,
may have been of vital importance to Turner. How these Sketch-Books
evoke the man and the moment. In one of them is 'A Study
for a Sea-Piece,' scrawled on a visiting-card, above the name of
Mr. J. M. W. Turner, 47 Queen Anne Street, Harley Street. The
number of studies of the sea he made during his life certainly
exceeded the number of visiting-cards he used.</p>

<h4>A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TERRIFIC 'SLAVE SHIP' AND
THE MILD 'NEW MOON'</h4>


<p>What a contrast is the cracked and faded picture 'The New Moon'
in the National Collection, also called 'I've lost my boat, you shan't
have your hoop,' with its sunset sky and young moon, the reflections
still beautiful in the wet sand, to the terrific and impossible
'Slave Ship,' now in America, with its sharks, its huddle of
bodies manacled and writhing in the water, and the iron chains
floating on the surface, as if they were corks. As Monkhouse justly
observes, one of Turner's finest conceptions is spoilt for the want
of a little commonsense.</p>

<p>How opinions differ. Of this picture Ruskin wrote: 'I think
the noblest sea that Turner has ever painted, and, if so, the noblest
certainly ever painted by man, is that of "The Slave Ship," the
chief Academy picture of the exhibition of 1840.' After a long and
eloquent description of the sea, without mentioning the sharks, or
the bodies, or the chains, he concludes: 'I believe, if I were reduced
to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose
this.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now quote George Innes, the American painter: 'Turner's
"Slave Ship" is the most infernal piece of clap-trap ever painted.
There is nothing in it. It has as much to do with human affections
and thought as a ghost. It is not even a fine bouquet of colour.
The colour is harsh, disagreeable and discordant.' Hamerton
suggested that the opinion of George Innes owes part of its severity
to reaction against Ruskin's eloquence.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Among the other pictures of this year were a 'Venice,' now at
the South Kensington Museum, the middle distance crowded, the
creamy towers beautiful; and the magnificent 'Rockets and Blue
Lights,' a tempestuous nocturne, impressionism run riot, which
fetched in the Yerkes sale at New York in 1910, £25,000, and which
was hailed in the transatlantic newspapers as the finest example
of Turner's genius ever seen in the United States. In this year,
also, perhaps later, may be placed 'The Arch of Constantine,
Rome,' that colour dream with the yellow sunset blazing behind
the tree, and the arch looking like a rose red ruin of the imagination.
Mr. Alfred Thornton, who has worked out minutely the actual
topography of this picture, has come to the conclusion that Turner
adhered very closely to the facts, obviously because the facts
happened to coincide with his vision. Of the companion picture,
'Tivoli,' Mr. Thornton says: 'The artist seems to have recorded
a series of impressions he might have gathered during an evening
walk at Tivoli. Scarcely any two parts of the picture are side by
side in nature, yet all can be identified with more or less certainty.'</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">'The Burning of the Ships,' which is the same size as 'The
Arch of Constantine' and 'Tivoli,' and probably arises, like them,
out of his last visit to Rome, is sheer vision, sheer imagination,
perhaps founded on some recollection of naval warfare, or a vague
memory of an incident in the <i>Iliad.</i> It is a fantasy of colour
and atmosphere. To look closely is to see clouds of smoke rising
from distant ships, with suggestions of an arch and buildings,
and galleys crowded with rowers; but Turner was beyond form
and definition when he painted 'The Burning of the Ships'; he
saw only the effect of the fire and the fury, lingering with much
loveliness in light.</p>

<p>In 1840 or later he painted many of the water-colours that
arrest us by their beauty in the new Turner Gallery, such as 'The
Lake of Lucerne, from Fluelen,' the large, unfinished 'Lake with
Distant Headlands and Palaces,' and that delight drawing in
Mr. Rawlinson's collection called 'In the Vale D'Aosta, a Passing
Shower.'</p>

<p>But of all the pictures produced this year the cracked and
faded 'New Moon,' with the sunset sky, and the funny additional
title, 'I 've lost my boat, you shan't have your hoop,' seems to
me the most personal to Turner. He is back in his boyhood at
Margate or elsewhere, running on the sands with little companions
and dogs at sunset, when the new moon was in the sky, and the
world was young,&mdash;a mild, pathetic little picture, a strange contrast
to the 'Slave Ship.'</p>

<h4>HOW TURNER DID IT? HE 'GRASPED THE HANDLE AND
PLUNGED THE WHOLE DRAWING INTO A PAIL OF WATER'</h4>


<p>Turner was represented by six pictures at the Royal Academy
this year&mdash;unimportant, not one worthy of his reputation. There
was a topographical Venice, which Chantrey bought on Varnishing
Day before he had seen it; and the rather decorative, rather
splendid, rather fatigued picture called 'Depositing of Giovanni
Bellini's three pictures in the Church of the Redentore, Venice,'
not one of which modern expert criticism allows to Bellini. Little
that would have mattered to Turner; he was concerned with the
look of the pageant only, a little confused&mdash;gold, red and blue
surging in sunlight. No doubt it pleased the old man to add the
name of Giovanni Bellini to the famous painters who are associated
with the descriptions of his pictures.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">The titles of the Sketch-Books of this year evoke all manner
of visions of beautiful places and the works associated with them&mdash;Lucerne,
the Rhine, Thun, Zug, Goldau, Fluelen, Bellinzona, Como,
Splugen and Grenoble.</p>

of the period, faint greens, faint purples, with touches of
red, the form all lost in colour, brooded over by the ridge of snow
mountains, the pencilled line of which has been left. In the
possession of Sir Hickman Bacon is a water-colour simply called
'A Swiss Lake,' the still water reflecting the rosy hills, and the
delicate blues and yellows of the sky&mdash;just iridescent atmosphere
floated upon the paper. I look at it, wonder how it was done,
and decide that the explanation by Leitch, the water-colour
painter, told by Mr. Shaw Sparrow in <i>The Studio</i>, as to 'how Turner
did it,' does not help me.</p>

<p>Leitch informed a friend of Mr. Sparrow's that he once accompanied
Pickersgill to Turner's studio, and there watched the great
man working, or shall I say composing. There were four drawing-boards,
each of which had a handle screwed to the back. After
the subject had been lightly sketched in, Turner grasped the handle
and plunged the whole drawing into a pail of water by his side.
'Then quickly he washed in the principal hues that he required,
flowing tint into tint, until this stage of the work was complete.
Leaving this first drawing to dry, he took the second board and
repeated the operation. By the time the fourth drawing was laid in,
the first would be ready for the finishing touches; and Leitch was
greatly impressed by the commonsense of the whole proceeding.'</p>

<p>Commonsense and genius, knowledge and daring, cunning and
simplicity: result&mdash;Turner's later water-colours.</p>

<h4>'THE SNOWSTORM' AND SOME 'FAULTLESS' WATER-COLOURS</h4>


<p>I open my thumbed copy of <i>Modern Painters</i>, turn to a certain
page in volume I., and read this: '"The Snowstorm," one of the
very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist, and light, that has
ever been put on canvas, even by Turner.'</p>

<p>In this appreciation we can go all the way with Ruskin. 'The
Snowstorm' in its new home in the new Turner Gallery looks the
work of a giant in the interpretation of sea-motion, mist and light.</p>

<p>The 'Snowstorm; Steamboat off a Harbour's Mouth making
Signals in shallow water and going by the lead,' was laughed at by
the press when it was shown in the 1842 Academy. The parody
of the title that appeared in <i>Punch</i> was almost funny; but the old
man did not think it funny: 'A Typhoon bursting in a Simoon
over the Whirlpool of Maelstrom, Norway; with a ship on fire, an
eelipse, and the effect of a lunar rainbow,' with the following skit
on the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
'O Art, how vast thy mighty wonders are<br />
To those who roam upon the extraordinary deep;<br />
Maelstrom, thy hand is here,'<br />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Thornbury asserts that the critics of all kinds, learned and
unlearned, were furious when it was exhibited; some of them
described it as a mass of 'soapsuds and whitewash.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Turner,' wrote Ruskin, 'was passing the evening at
my father's house, on the day this criticism came out; and
after dinner, sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, I heard him
muttering low to himself, at intervals, "Soapsuds and whitewash"
again, and again, and again. At last I went to him,
asking why he minded what they said. Then he burst out,
"Soapsuds and whitewash! What would they have?
I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd
been in it."'</p></blockquote>

<p>As a matter of fact, Turner had given himself infinitely more
trouble over 'The Snowstorm' than over 'The Fighting Téméraire,'
and he had been in considerable danger. To paint 'The Snowstorm,'
he had put to sea from Harwich in the <i>Ariel</i> in a hurricane,
had made the sailors lash him to the mast, and there the student
of sixty-seven remained for four hours studying the awful scene. I
look at 'The Snowstorm' to-day, and remember. I am filled with
awe at the man's power. No, we do not smile at 'The Snowstorm'
now; but certain folk still smile at 'War: The Exile and the Rock
Limpet,' depicting an attenuated Napoleon, standing against a
blood-red sunset, in the shallows of a tidal pool, on the shore of
St. Helena, gazing with folded arms out to sea. Turner failed
to make this nobly inspired dream a reality&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Punch</i> made merry over the 'Exile and the Rock Limpet,'
calling it 'The Duke of Wellington and the Shrimp (Seringapatam,
early morning),' with another parody of the <i>Fallacies</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'And can it be, thou hideous imp,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">(From an unpublished poem.)'</span><br />

<p>And remarked that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The comet just rising above the cataract in the foreground,
and the conflagration of Tippoo's widow in the Banyan
forest by the sea-shore, are in the great artist's happiest
manner.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'Peace, Burial at Sea of the Body of Sir David Wilkie,' was a
vision which Turner completely realised, the poetry, the pathos,
the grandeur, the decorative splendour&mdash;all. The sails of the
steamship are dark against the evening sky, as if in mourning,
and amidships, in a blaze of torchlight, the body of Wilkie is being
lowered to his watery grave. Stanfield, who saw the picture on
Varnishing Day, thought the effect of the sails was 'untrue,'
which, of course, they are, but Turner would not alter them. 'I
only wish I had any colour to make them blacker,' said the old
warrior.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">From this picture of peace and solemnity I turn to the peace
and loveliness of some 'smaller' water-colours of this, his sunset,
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Ruskin, in his 'Notes on Turner's Drawings exhibited at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Fine Art Society in 1878,' which is printed as the Epilogue to the
volume called <i>Notes on Pictures</i>, tells how in the winter of 1841-42
Turner brought back with him from Switzerland a series of sketches,
fifteen of which he placed, as was his custom, in the hands of his
agent, Griffith of Norwood, so that he might obtain commissions
for finished drawings of each.</p>

<p>Ruskin tells us that 'he made anticipatorily four, to manifest
what their quality would be, and honestly "show his hand."
Four thus exemplary drawings I say he made for specimens, or
signs, as it were, for his re-opened shop, namely:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Pass of Splugen.</p>

<p>2. Mont Righi, seen from Lucerne, in the morning, dark
against dawn.</p>

<p>3. Mont Righi, seen from Lucerne at evening, red with
the last rays of sunset.</p>

<p>4. Lake Lucerne (The Bay of Uri) from above Brunnen,
with exquisite blue and rose mists and 'mackerel'
sky on the right.</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole story, which is told in Ruskin's most simple and
charming style, is too long to be repeated here. Nine commissions
only could be obtained, making ten with the one given to Griffith
as commission. 'Turner growled, but said at last that he would
do them,' and among them was a 'Lucerne Town,' which Ruskin,
by hard coaxing and petitioning, obtained his father's leave to
promise to take if it turned out well. It did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>What a wonderful realisation of a dream of colour is another
water-colour of this period, reproduced in these pages&mdash;'Spietz on
the Lake of Thun, Looking Towards the Bernese Oberland.'</p>

<p>On the last page of the Ruskin Catalogue, which is now called
Epilogue, the old man, most eloquent and most sorrowful, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The "Constance" and "Coblentz" here with the
"Splugen" (1), "Bay of Uri" (4), and "Zurich" (10), of
the year 1812, are the most finished and faultless works of
his last period; but these of 1843 are the truest and mightiest
 ... I can't write any more of them just now.'</p></blockquote>

<p>About this time Munro of Novar offered twenty-five thousand
pounds for the whole contents of the Queen Anne Street Gallery.
Turner hesitated, but finally refused. Frith, in his <i>Autobiography</i>,
tells the story thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'When Munro of Novar went for his final answer,
Turner cried, "No! I won't&mdash;I can't. I believe I am going
to die, and I intend to be buried in those two (pointing to
"Carthage" and "The Sun Rising Through Vapour"), so
I can't&mdash;besides I can't be bothered. Good-evening!"'</p></blockquote>

<p>The evening of his life was to last nine years, and Turner found
his own way of escape from being bothered.</p>

<h4>VISIONS OF VENICE AND THE FIRST VOLUME OF
'MODERN PAINTERS'</h4>


<p>The two pictures of Venice exhibited in 1843, so changed, so faded,
are in their way among the loveliest things Turner ever painted.
'San Benedetto, Looking Towards Fusina,' was formerly known
as 'The Approach to Venice,' and I wish that title could have
been retained, as one always thinks of it as 'The Approach to
Venice,' and always in connection with the companion picture,
'The "Sun of Venice" Going to Sea,' with the name of this immortalised,
fishing-boat 'Sol di Venezia' conspicuous on the sail.
These two fading visions of Venice are indescribable, although
everybody attempts to describe them. An eloquent passage may
be found in the essay M. de la Sizeranne wrote for <i>The Studio</i> on
'The Genius of Turner,' from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Nothing will be found more beautiful than the "Approach"
itself. No robe from Tintoretto's brush will be
found to possess the splendour of the gondolas conveying
us. No Titian&mdash;that of the mountains of Cadore, the
presence of which we divine, no nimbus about the head
of a saint, will equal that sun, no purple these skies, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
prayer the infinite sweetness of the dream experienced
during those brief, delicious moments. Nothing will be
found to compare with the distant vision of that city which,
on the horizon, seems to be too beautiful ever to be reached,
and appears to recede from the traveller's barque&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Ainsi que Dèle sur le mer</i>,<br />
</p>

<p>gilded like youth, silent as dreams, and like happiness
unattainable.'</p></blockquote>


<p>Earlier in the Essay this sensitive writer says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'Turner was the first of the Impressionists, and after
a lapse of eighty years he remains the greatest, at least in
the styles he has treated. That Impressionism came from
England is proved by the letters of Delacroix, and demonstrated
by M. Paul Signac in his pamphlet on "Neo-Impressionism."
... Turner is the father of the Impressionists.
Their discoveries are his. He first saw that
Nature is composed in a like degree of colours and of lines,
and, in his evolution, the rigid and settled lines of his early
method gradually melt away and vanish in the colours.
He sought to paint the atmosphere, the envelopment of
coloured objects seen at a distance, rather than the things
enveloped: and he quickly realised that the atmosphere
could not be expressed, except through the infinite parcelling
out of things which Claude Lorrain drew in a solid grouping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>and painting <i>en bloc.</i> He shredded the clouds. He
took the massive and admirable masses, the <i>cumuli</i> of
Ruysdael, of Hobbema, of Van de Velde, picked the threads
out of them, and converted them into a myriad-shaded
charpie, which he entrusted to the winds of heaven.'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Time has been cruel to both these Venetian pictures, perhaps
cruel only to be kind. Even in Ruskin's time much of the transparency
had gone; but there they are, dreams of Venice; not
the Venice we see, not the Venice that Canaletto saw, but the
Venice that floated before the eyes of Turner, that blossomed in
the imagination of an old man nearing his seventieth year. I
suppose we must call the other pictures of 1843 failures, but only
because he tried to express the inexpressible&mdash;such themes as
'The Evening of the Deluge' and 'The Morning After,' with
Moses writing the book of Genesis, mixed up with Goethe's theory
of Light and Colour, and accompanied by an extract from the
<i>Fallacies of Hope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'The ark stood firm on Ararat: the returning sun<br />
Exhaled earth's humid bubbles, and emulous of light,<br />
Reflected her lost forms, each in prismatic guise.'<br />
</p>

<p>In this year, too, he exhibited 'The Opening of the Walhalla,'
which has been banished to the honourable seclusion of the Dublin
National Gallery. This Doric temple, erected on a hill overlooking
the Danube, containing two hundred marble busts of eminent
Germans, had been opened by King Ludwig of Bavaria in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
previous year. The idea inspired Turner; he painted a characteristic
picture of the ceremony and sent it to King Ludwig, who
returned the gift with the comment that he did not understand
it. Poor Turner! Munich would be well content to own the
'Walhalla' now.</p>

<p>In 1843 the first volume of <i>Modern Painters</i> was published,
which 'originated,' as Ruskin tells us, 'in indignation at the
shallow and false criticisms of the periodicals of the day of the
works of the great living artist to whom it principally refers.' The
second volume was not published until 1846; the third and fourth
in 1856, and the fifth and last volume of this 'enormous work of
thought, inspiration, sincerity and devotion' in 1860.</p>

<p>We have it on the authority of Thornbury, that Turner was
vexed at Ruskin's panegyrics, and said, 'The man put things into
my head I never thought of.' I doubt if Turner was vexed at the
panegyrics, but it is quite certain that Ruskin's imagination saw
things in the pictures that Turner never 'thought of.' Turner
was a man of deeds, not of thoughts. He worked with his eyes,
hand, and spirit: he was Nature's lover. It is certain, too, that after
the first irritation felt by his contemporaries at some of the wilder
works of Turner's later years had cooled, his fame would have
steadily increased, and would have been as high as it is to-day,
had <i>Modern Painters</i> never been written.</p>

of the sun, and the boiling foam in the wake of the boat, and at
luncheon-time eating shrimps out of an immense silk handkerchief
laid across his knees. And while he was eating shrimps and
watching the movement of the water, those who had reached the
end of the first volume of <i>Modern Painters</i> were perhaps reading
with shining eyes and lifted hearts the concluding passage about
'the great artist whose works have formed the chief subject of this
treatise':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In all that he says, we believe: in all that he does, we
trust.... He stands upon an eminence, from which he
looks back over the universe of God, and forward over the
generations of men. Let every work of his hand be a history
of the one, and a lesson to the other. Let each exertion of
his mighty mind be both hymn and prophecy; adoration
to the Deity, revelation to mankind.'</p></blockquote>

Queen Anne Street, described how he heard the shambling, slippered
footstep coming down the stairs, the cold, cheerless room, the
gallery, even less tidy and more forlorn, all confusion, mouldiness
and wretched litter; most of the pictures covered with uncleanly
sheets, and the man! 'his loose dress, his ragged hair, his indifferent

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The exhibited pictures included that masterpiece in impressionism,
'Rain, Steam, and Speed.' Turner's whole life may be
said to have been a preparation for this <i>tour de force</i>; all the
knowledge that he had acquired, all the facts that he had accumulated,
are used in this brilliant synthesis of the effect upon the eye
of rushing movement through atmosphere. Has Claude Monet, who
acknowledged the impulse he received from studying Turner in 1870,
ever visualised movement, light and atmosphere in one impression,
as did this wonderful Turner in his seventieth year? But though
his power to express a fleeting vision was at its height in this
picture, his ability to express his thoughts was as stumbling as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>ever, shown by the following&mdash;printed with other letters by Sir
Walter Armstrong in his volume on Turner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">'47 <span class="smcap">Queen Anne Street</span>,
<i>Dec. 28th,</i> 1844.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Hawkesworth</span>,&mdash;First let me say I am very
glad to hear Mrs. Fawkes has recovered in health so as to
make Torquay air no longer absolute, and that the Isle of
Wight will, I do trust, completely establish her health and
yours (confound the gout which you work under), tho'
thanks to your perseverance in penning what you did,
and likewise for the praises of a gossiping letter, thanks to
Charlotte Fawkes, who said you thought of Shanklin, but
you left me to conjecture solely by the postmark Shanklin&mdash;Ryde&mdash;
so now I scribble this to the first place in the hope
of <i>thanking</i> your kindness in the remembrance of me by
the Yorkshire Pie equal good to the olden time of Hannah's
culinary exploits.</p>

<p>'Now for myself, the rigours of winter begin to tell upon
me, rough and cold, and more acted upon by changes of
weather than when we used to trot about at Farnley, but
it must be borne with all the thanks due for such a lengthened
period.</p>

<p>'I went, however, to Lucerne and Switzerland, little
thinking of supposing such a cauldron of squabbling,
political or religious, I was walking over. The rains came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on early so I could not cross the Alps, twice I tried, was sent
back with a wet jacket and worn-out boots, and after getting
them heel-tapped, I marched up some of the small valleys
of the Rhine and found them more interesting than I
expected.</p>

<p>'Now do you keep your promise and so recollect that
London is not so much out of nearest route to Farnley now
... Shanklin, and (I) do feel confoundedly mortified in
not knowing your location when I was once so near you, for
I saw Louis Philippe land at Portsmouth.&mdash;Believe me,
dear Hawkesworth, Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">J. M. W. Turner</span>.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another blow fell upon Turner this year. The Mr. Hammersley
aforementioned visited him again in Queen Anne Street, and
gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Our proceedings resembled our proceedings on the
former visit, distinguished from it, however, by the exceeding
taciturnity, yet restlessness of my great companion,
who walked about and occasionally clutched a letter which
he held in his hand. I feared to break the dead silence,
varied only by the slippered scrape of Turner's feet, as he
paced from end to end of the dim and dusty apartment.
At last he stood abruptly, and turning to me, said, "Mr.
Hammersley, you <i>must</i> excuse me, I cannot stay another
moment; the letter I hold in my hand has just been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
to me, and it announces the death of my friend Callcott."
He said no more; I saw his fine gray eyes fill as he vanished,
and I left at once.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The loss of friends set his mind dwelling upon the past, and
it was no doubt in gratitude to all he owed to Ruysdael that he
painted and exhibited this year the vivacious sea-piece now in
the National Gallery, which he called 'Fishing-Boats Bringing a
Disabled Ship into Port Ruysdael.' Needless to say, there is no
such port anywhere. He also exhibited the beautiful Approach
to Venice' in the possession of Sir Charles Tennant; and&mdash;the
old man twice tried to cross the Alps on foot, referred to in the
above letter, which is almost as wonderful as painting a picture.
It would seem that he really succeeded in the enterprise if
'passed' means 'crossed,' as in the 'Grindelwald' Sketch-Book,
against a drawing of mountains, is the following scrawl:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'No matter what bef [? befell] Hannibel&mdash;W.B. and
J.M.W.T. passed the Alps from [? near] Fombey [?] Sep. 3,
1844.'</p></blockquote>

<h4>PICTURES OF WHALERS, AND AN ENTRY ON THE LAST
PAGE OF HIS LAST SKETCH-BOOK</h4>

<p>Now, when he is nearing his decline, Turner is described as
stooping very much, and looking down. Thinking of Turner
'looking down,' I recall the story that came to Sir Walter Armstrong
from Mr. Stopford Brooke: how some one who knew Turner,
at least by sight, was one day passing along the wharves beyond
the Palace of Westminster, when he noticed the figure of a sturdy
man in black squatting on his heels at the river's edge, and looking
down intently into the water. Passing on, he thought for the
moment no more about it. But on his return, half an hour later,
the figure was still there, and still intent in the same way. That
watcher was Turner, and the object of his interest was the pattern
made by the ripples at the edge of the tide.</p>

<p>Ruskin says that this year his health, and with it in great
degree, his mind, failed suddenly. And to Ruskin we owe this
pathetic passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The last drawing in which there remained a reflection
of his expiring power, he made in striving to realise, for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
one of these faint and fair visions of the morning mist fading
from the Lake of Lucerne.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
'"There ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand ...<br />
For what is your life?"'<br /></p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">Plate XXXVIII. <span class="smcap">Sunrise With a Sea Monster</span> (<i>about</i> 1845) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">And Turner was going his own way, making his little jokes.
On June 31st, 1845, he wrote to Mr. E. Bicknell of Heme Hill:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, SIR,&mdash;I will thank you to call in Queen Anne
Street at your earliest convenience, for I have a whale or
two on the canvas.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter, of course, referred to the 'Whalers' pictures,
exhibited in 1845 and 1846.</p>

<p>The 'Whalers' Sketch-Book contains drawings of 'Steamer
Leaving Harbour,' 'Burning Blubber,' 'Whalers at Sea,' 'Study
of Fish,' etc. Perhaps he made a voyage; perhaps he talked with
sailors in one of his haunts at Wapping, and learnt from them of
the wonders of the deep waters related by Arctic voyagers. However
the idea or the vision came he now makes sketches of whaling
subjects and paints pictures of 'Whalers,' one of which is in the
Turner Gallery, four boats' crews attacking their prey with harpoons,
and in the background are the white sails of their vessels,
dimly seen through mists and snow wreaths. The imaginative
'Sunrise with a Sea Monster' probably belongs to the 'Whalers'
period. On the misty waters of the ocean, reflecting a yellow
sunrise, a sea monster, with a head like a magnified red gurnet,
advances, the huge head towering out of the water. In the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
are forms suggesting icebergs. <i>Punch</i> had a genial sneer at a
'Whalers' picture:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It embodies one of those singular effects which are only met
with in lobster salads and in this artist's pictures.
Whether he calls his picture "Whalers" or "Venice," or
"Morning," or "Noon," or "Night," it is all the same; for
it is quite as easy to fancy it one thing as another.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Thornbury is responsible for the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I am afraid the tradition is too true, that that great
and bitter satirist of poor humanity's weaknesses, Mr.
Thackeray, had more than a finger in thus lashing the dotage
of a great man's genius. Long after, I have heard that
Mr. Thackeray was shown some of Turner's finest water-colour
drawings, upon which he exclaimed: "I will never
run down Turner again." But the blows had already gone
to the old man's heart, and it did no good to lament them
then.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Sketch-Books of 1845 and 1846, we find him at 'Folkestone,'
'Hythe and Walmer,' 'Ambleteuse and Wimereux,'
'Boulogne,' 'Eu and Treport,' 'Dieppe,' and back again at 'Folkestone.'
In the last of all the Sketch-Books, 'Kent,' 1845-46, when
Turner was over seventy, is this against a drawing of 'Houses and
Church':</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'May 30. Margate, a small opening along the horizon
marked the approach of the sun by its getting yellow,' etc.</p></blockquote>

<h4>THE BEGINNING OF TURNER'S DECLINE, AND A
'GREY, DIM DRAWING'</h4>


<p>The story of Turner's art life really ended in the last chapter: there
is little more to tell, yet 'Queen Mab's Grotto,' which he exhibited
at the British Institution in 1846, flickers with the old splendour.
The sultry arch of trees in the foreground, the golden castle rising
to the sky, have something of the old witchery, and the mundane
fairies are more attractive than many of his clothed foreground
fishermen. In this picture he rivalled nobody but himself, but
the suggestion clearly came from Shakespeare, and it was the old
man's pleasure to couple the names of Shakespeare and Turner
in the catalogue, with this from <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Frisk it, frisk it by the moonlight beam.'<br />
</p>

<p>And this from the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Thy orgies, Mab, are manifold.'<br />
</p>

<p>The other pictures of this year have the old extravagance of
title, little more. They were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Hurrah for the Whaler Erebus! Another Fish!'</p>

<p>'Undine giving the Ring to Massaniello, Fisherman of Naples.'</p>

<p>'The Angel Standing in the Sun,' with quotations from
Revelation and the poet Rogers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>'Whalers (boiling blubber) entangled in flaw ice, endeavouring
to extricate themselves.'</p>

<p>'Returning from the Ball (St. Martha).'</p>

<p>'Going to the Ball (San Martino).'</p></blockquote>

<p>His ambition was as buoyant as ever, and the look of his eyes
as keen; but his hand was beginning to lose its power. Ruskin
has this curt comment:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I shall take no notice of the three pictures painted in
the period of his decline ("Undine," "The Angel Standing
in the Sun," and "The Hero of a Hundred Fights"). It
was ill-judged to exhibit them; they occupy to Turner's
other works precisely the relation which <i>Count Robert of
Paris</i> and <i>Castle Dangerous</i> hold to Scott's early novels.'</p></blockquote>

<p>One could continue indefinitely quoting Ruskin on Turner,
ranging, as he does, through the whole gamut from eulogy to
chastisement, from adoration to grief. Here is a passage that
arrests me as I turn his pages: pathetic, but a wilful misunderstanding
of Turner's temperament:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">'There is something very strange and sorrowful in the
way Turner used to hint only at these under-meanings of
his; leaving us to find them out, helplessly; and if we
did <i>not</i> find them out, no word more ever came from him.
Down to the grave he went, silent. "You cannot read me;
you do not care for me; let it all pass; go your ways."'</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>And here is a wail that is probably quite within the sad truth.
In a note to the first volume of <i>Modern Painters</i>, after remarking
sadly that 'Turner is exceedingly unequal,' that he has failed
most frequently 'in elaborate compositions,' and that 'finding
fault with Turner is not either decorous in myself or likely to be
beneficial to the reader,' Ruskin continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The reader will have observed that I strictly limited
the perfection of Turner's works to the time of their first
appearing on the walls of the Royal Academy. It bitterly
grieves me to have to do this, but the fact is indeed so.
No <i>picture</i> of Turner's is seen in perfection a month after
it is painted. The 'Walhalla' cracked before it had been
eight days in the Academy rooms; the vermilions frequently
lose lustre long before the Exhibition is over; and
when all the colours begin to get hard a year or two after
the picture is painted, a painful deadness and opacity come
over them, the whites especially becoming lifeless, and many
of the warmer passages settling into a hard valueless brown,
even if the paint remains perfectly firm, which is far from
being always the case. I believe that in some measure
these results are unavoidable, the colours being so peculiarly
blended and mingled in Turner's present manner, as almost
to necessitate their irregular drying; but that they are not
necessary to the extent in which they sometimes take place,
is proved by the comparative safety of some even of the
more brilliant works. Thus the "Old Téméraire" is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
safe in colour, and quite firm; while the "Juliet and Her
Nurse" is now the ghost of what it was; the "Slaver"
shows no cracks, though it is chilled in some of the darker
passages, while the "Walhalla" and several of the recent
Venices cracked in the Royal Academy.'</p></blockquote>

<p>How the attacks and parodies of Turner must have pained
Ruskin! This, for example, from <i>Punch</i> on 'Venice, Morning,
Returning from the Ball':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'We had almost forgotten Mr. J. M. W. Turner, R.A.,
and his celebrated MS. poem, the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>, to which
he constantly refers us, as "in former years"; but on this
occasion, he has obliged us by simply mentioning the title
of the poem, without troubling us with an extract. We will,
however, supply a motto to his "Morning&mdash;Returning from
the Ball," which really seems to need a little explanation;
and as he is too modest to quote the <i>Fallacies of Hope</i>, we
will quote for him:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
'Oh, what a scene! Can this be Venice? No.<br />
And yet methinks it is&mdash;because I see<br />
Amid the lumps of yellow, red and blue,<br />
Something which looks like a Venetian spire.<br />
That dash of orange in the background there<br />
Bespeaks 'tis morning. And that little boat<br />
(Almost the colour of Tomato sauce)<br />
Proclaims them now returning from the ball:<br />
This is my picture I would fain convey,<br />
I hope I do. Alas! what Fallacy!'<br />

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The following pen-picture is no parody. Wilkie Collins told
Thornbury that when a boy&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'He used to attend his father on varnishing days, and
remembers seeing Turner (not the more perfect in his balance
for the brown sherry at the Academy lunch), seated on the
top of a flight of steps, astride a box. There he sat, a
shabby Bacchus, nodding like a Mandarin at his picture,
which he, with a pendulum motion, now touched with his
brush, and now receded from. Yet, in spite of sherry,
precarious seat and old age, he went on shaping in some
wonderful dream of colour; every touch meaning something,
every pin's head of colour being a note in the
chromatic scale.'</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing sad in that; but who can look at or recall that
'grey, dim drawing, with one or two specks of light from craft on
the river,' called 'Twilight in the Lorreli,' without emotion?
This was one of the fifty-three drawings that Turner had brought
years before straight to Farnley on his return from the Rhine.
Long afterwards, possibly in this year, Hawkesworth Fawkes
conveyed the set to the dreary house in Queen Anne Street
to show to their creator. The old man turned over the drawings
until he came to 'Twilight in the Lorreli.' His eyes filled with
tears, and he muttered, 'But, Hawkey! but, Hawkey!'</p>

<p class="center">1847, 1848 AND 1849: AGED SEVENTY-TWO TO SEVENTY-FOUR</p>

<h4>HE DISAPPEARS FROM HIS OLD HAUNTS, AND IS INTERESTED
IN OPTICS AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h4>


<p>Turner's art life almost ceased during the years 1847, 1848 and
1849. Three old-new pictures only were exhibited: 'The Hero
of a Hundred Fights,' probably an early picture re-touched,
and two works of former years: 'The Wreck Buoy,' which he repainted,
spending 'six laborious days' upon it, and 'Venus and
Adonis,' dating from nearly fifty years before, after his visit to the
Louvre in 1802.</p>

<p>The interest of these years, if it be an interest, is centred in his
cunning and successful efforts to escape from the notice of friends
and companions, and to withdraw his private life from any kind
of intrusion. The doors of Queen Anne Street were locked and
barred, and when he was absent from home, which was often, his
old housekeeper, Hannah Danby, had no knowledge of his hiding-place.
Sometimes he was seen at a council meeting of the Royal
Academy or on Varnishing Day, but his friends were rarely able
to obtain speech with him. Hawkesworth Fawkes tried to keep
up acquaintance with his father's old Mend, and every Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a hamper arrived in Queen Anne Street from Farnley. There is
a letter to Hawkesworth dated December 27th, 1847, beginning:&mdash;'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many thanks for the P.P.P., viz., Pie, Phea, and Pud&mdash;the
Xmas cheer in Queen Anne Street.'</p></blockquote>

<p>One day, so the story runs, an artist took shelter in a public-house,
where he found Turner sitting in the furthest corner with his
glass of grog before him. Said the unnamed artist: 'I didn't
know you used this house. I shall often drop in now I know
where you quarter.' Turner emptied his glass, and as he went
out said, 'Will you? I don't think you will.'</p>

<p>The secret of his hiding-place was not discovered until a day
or two before his death. As everybody now knows, he lived
mainly, during those last years, in the little house with the roof
balcony facing the Thames at Cremorne, in what is called to-day
Cheyne Walk. The story current for years was that he passed
the house in one of his rambles, saw that rooms were vacant, liked
the place, and after some bargaining with the landlady, agreed
co become the tenant. He asked her name, and upon receiving
the answer, 'Mrs. Booth,' chuckled, 'Then I'll be Mr. Booth.'
This story is incorrect, as he had made the acquaintance of Sophia
Caroline Booth years before, when she let lodgings at Margate.
As it is believed that Turner paid his last visit to Margate in 1845,
it is probable that he transferred Mrs. Booth to the little house
at Chelsea in that year. Her name appears in a codicil to his
will, dated February 1st, 1849, giving her the same provision as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Hannah Danby, his housekeeper in Queen Anne Street, who had
entered his service, a girl of sixteen, in the year 1801. Hannah
Danby and Mrs. Booth both survived him.</p>

<p>Turner's curiosity, his eagerness for wider knowledge about
his art and all that pertained to it, never relaxed, even in this
period of his failing powers. One of the most interesting chapters
in Thornbury's <i>Life</i> is the account given by Mayall, the photographer
of Regent Street, of Turner's interest in optics and photography.
I append portions of the information furnished by Mayall,
whom Thornbury describes as 'that eminent professor in the progressing
and wonderful art':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Turner's visits to my atelier were in 1847, 1848 and
1849. I took several admirable daguerreotype portraits
of him, one of which was reading, a position rather favourable
for him on account of his weak eyes and their being
rather bloodshot.... My first interviews with him were
rather mysterious; he either did state, or at least led me
to believe, that he was a Master in Chancery, and his subsequent
visits and conversation rather confirmed this idea.
At first he was very desirous of trying curious effects of light
let in on the figure from a high position, and he himself sat
for the studies.... He stayed with me some three hours,
talking about light and its curious effects on films of prepared
silver. He expressed a wish to see the spectral image copied,
and asked me if I had ever repeated Mrs. Somerville's experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of magnetising a needle in the rays of the spectrum.
I told him I had.</p>

<p>'I was not then aware that the inquisitive old man
was Turner, the painter. At the same time, I was much
impressed with his inquisitive disposition, and I carefully
explained to him all I then knew of the operation of light
on iodized silver plates. He came again and again, always
with some new notion about light....'</p></blockquote>

<p>Mayall tells us that Turner when he visited him bore the marks
of age; but in the profile drawing of this period, ascribed to Linnell,
with the straggling hair, the powerful nose, and the enormous stock
about his neck, the face is keen, and the artist has quite caught
the gleam of the grey eye. This drawing is not by Linnell, as
has been hitherto supposed, but by Landseer and Count d'Orsay in
conjunction. Mr. A. S. Bicknell, who was present when the sketch
was made, contributed to the <i>Athenæum</i> of January 9th, 1909, the
following letter on this subject, as interesting as it is authoritative:&mdash;'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'A few days ago I first saw a handsome quarto "Turner,
by Sir Walter Armstrong, 1902," in which, as a second
frontispiece, I found a head and shoulders portrait of that
great artist, described on the opposite leaf as "from the
sketch in water-colours by J. Linnell, in the collection of
James Orrock, Esq."</p>

<p>'During the last fifty years I have occasionally come
across a reference to this likeness, declaring that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
probably the work of some contemporary painter, sketched
at a meeting or private entertainment; but as these surmises
have at length crystallised into a positive assertion
concerning Linnell, I think it may be well to place the truth
on record.</p>

<p>'My father, Elhanan Bicknell, of Herne Hill, frequently
entertained at dinner a large company of the most distinguished
artists and patrons of art, amongst whom Turner,
but never Linnell, was often one. It being the case that
Turner objected to having his portrait taken, on an occasion
of that kind two conspirators, Count D'Orsay and Sir
Edwin Landseer, devised a little plot to defeat the result
of this antipathy. Whilst Turner unsuspiciously chatted
with a guest over a cup of tea in the drawing-room, D'Orsay
placed himself as screen beside him to hide, when necessary,
Landseer sketching him at full length in pencil on the back
of a letter. Landseer gave what he had done to D'Orsay,
who, after re-drawing it at home, and enlarging the figure to
eight inches in height, sold it to J. Hogarth, printseller
in the Haymarket, for twenty guineas; and it was then
lithographed and published by the latter, January 1st, 1851,
with the title of Turner's mysterious poem, <i>The Fallacies
of Hope</i>, at the bottom. Sixteen copies were included in
the Bicknell sale at Christie's in 1863. The Louis XIV.
panelling of the room, as well as a piano, inlaid with Sèvres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
plaques, are indicated in the background; and I may also
mention that I was present at that party, which took place,
to the best of my belief, about Christmas, 1847, or early in
1849.</p>

<p>'Ruskin, who seldom admitted any blemish, even in
the person of his hero, called this portrait a caricature, but
it was nothing of the kind; I knew Turner extremely well,
and I have always considered it to be a most admirable,
truthful likeness; indeed, the only one exactly portraying
his general appearance and expression in his latter years.'</p></blockquote>

<p>So here we have a likeness of Turner in the period of his decline
and disappearance from his old haunts, an authentic likeness at
one of his re-appearances&mdash;chatting with a guest over a cup of tea
in a Herne Hill drawing-room.</p>

<p class="center">1850: AGED SEVENTY-FIVE</p>

<h4>HIS LAST FOUR PICTURES PAINTED IN HIDING AT CHELSEA</h4>


<p>In 1850, the year before his death, Turner sent four pictures to
the Royal Academy, an heroic attempt on the veteran's part to
assure the world that his power had not deserted him; but these
canvases are but the tottering ruins of his genius, and they have
been hung among other 'splendid failures' in the large, lower room
of the Turner Gallery. But, as I have said before, Turner's 'splendid
failures' are merely less great than his triumphs. His 'failures' in
the large, lower room of the Turner Gallery, would easily make
a lesser man's reputation. These four valedictory works entitled
'Æneas relating his Story to Dido,' 'Mercury sent to admonish
Æneas,' 'The Departure of the Trojan Fleet,' and 'The Visit to
the Tomb,' were painted between January and April, 1850, in a
small room, with a small window, in the little house at Cremorne.
We are told that at this window, and on the roof balcony, he would
spend a long time each day studying the ways of the sun, the effect
of light on the river and on the open places of rural Chelsea; and
that he would often rise early, paint for a little, and then return to
bed. Mrs. Booth declared that some of his last work was inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
by his dreams; that one night she heard him calling out excitedly;
that she gave him the drawing materials he asked for, and that he
made some notes, which he afterwards used for a picture. Mrs.
Booth also confessed that she could not resist whispering in the
neighbourhood that 'Booth' was a great man in disguise, and
that when he died he would surely be buried in St. Paul's. This
local gossip was collected later by John Pye the engraver.</p>

<p>Here I may print, for what it is worth, a letter, that was sent
to me by an unknown correspondent in reference to a small book on
Turner I wrote three years ago:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">'<span class="smcap">Clapham</span>, <i>March</i> 1907.</p>

<p class="center">'<i>Re</i> Turner.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In the eighties (I think) there resided
at Haddenham Hall, Haddenham, Bucks, a Mrs. Booth,
whom it was understood was Turner's widow. I expressed
a wish to look over the Hall, and was received
by the old lady herself (she was a very homely body, and
always wore a big cotton apron). In one of the rooms
I recognised a miniature portrait of the late Dr. Price of
Margate. Mrs. Booth said, "Yes! it was painted by my
husband, Mr. Turner the artist; he and the Doctor were
great friends." I also understood that Turner lodged with
her when painting his pictures of Margate.</p>

<p>'When Mrs. Booth died she was taken to Margate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
be buried. As I have never read of Turner's marriage, this
may prove interesting.</p>

<p><i>'P.S.</i>&mdash;The son of the late Dr. Price still resides at
Margate.'</p></blockquote>

<p>In a letter to Hawkesworth Fawkes, dated December 27th,
1850, Turner wrote: 'Old Time has made sad work with me since
I saw you in town.' But a certain dinner at David Roberts's
house shows that old Time did not prevent him from being merry
and sociable after his manner. The account of this dinner in
1850 is printed in a note to Ballantyne's <i>Life of David Roberts.</i>
Turner's manner at the feast is described as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Very agreeable, his quick bright eye sparkled, and his
whole countenance showed a desire to please. He was
constantly making, or trying to make jokes; his dress,
though rather old-fashioned, was far from being shabby.
Turner's health was proposed by an Irish gentleman who
had attended his lectures on perspective, on which he complimented
the artist. Turner made a short reply in a
jocular way, and concluded by saying, rather sarcastically,
that he was glad this honourable gentleman had profited
so much by his lectures as thoroughly to understand perspective,
for it was more than he did. Turner afterwards,
in Roberts's absence, took the chair, and, at Stanfield's
request, proposed Roberts's health, which he did, speaking
hurriedly, but soon ran short of words and breath, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
dropped down on his chair with a hearty laugh, starting
up again and finishing with a "hip, hip, hurrah!"...
Turner was the last who left, and Roberts accompanied
him along the street to hail a cab.... When the cab drove
up, he assisted Turner to his seat, shut the door, and asked
where he should tell cabby to take him; but Turner was
not to be caught, and, with a knowing wink, replied, "Tell
him to drive to Oxford Street, and then I'll direct him where
to go."'</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Martin Shee died this year, and it is said that Turner was
aggrieved that he was not offered the Presidentship of the Royal
Academy. It is difficult to realise Turner in that office this year
or in any year of his life. He was not made for official duties, but
to make beautiful and wonderful things.</p>

<p class="center">1851: AGED SEVENTY-SIX</p>


<h4>THE MYSTERY OF THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE REVEALED
TO HIS FRIENDS: AND HIS DEATH</h4>


<p>I leaned against the parapet of the Embankment in Cheyne
Walk, Chelsea, and gazed at the row of cosy little houses on
the other side of the road that face the Thames. The house
where Turner died, I had been told, is now 119 Cheyne Walk.
My eyes sought 119, but found it not. The numbers passed from
118 to 120. Then I crossed the road to discover that Nos. 118
and 119 have been converted into one house. Peering, I discerned,
almost hidden by Virginia creeper, a tablet saying that here Turner
died.</p>

<p>So this was the house. Somewhere near here 'Puggy Booth,'
as he was known to the street boys, 'Admiral Booth' to the
tradesmen, moored his boat. The story was current in Chelsea
that he was an Admiral in reduced circumstances, and Turner was
not the man to illumine a mystery, or end a joke.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">We learn from Thornbury that up to the period of his final
illness, he would often rise at daybreak, leave his bed with some
blanket or dressing-gown carelessly thrown over him, and ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to the railed-in roof to watch the sunrise, and see the colour flush
the morning sky.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="turner_0042"></a>
<img src="images/turner_0042.jpg" width="600" alt="" /> <p
class="caption">Plate XLII. <span class="smcap">Lake of Brienz. Water colour</span> (<i>about</i> 1843)
Victoria and Albert Museum</p></div>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">There was the railed-in roof, crowning the 'Cremorne Cottage,'
that in Turner's time had green sward to the edge of the river:
the house with three windows only, one in the basement, and one
each on the first and second floors. In the room on the second
floor, where he painted his last four pictures, he died. I remembered
what I had read of the talk of the undertaker's men about
the shabbiness of the place, and the narrowness of the staircase,
so circumscribed, that to carry the coffin up was impossible:
they were obliged to convey the body down to the coffin.</p>

<p>Then my thoughts turned to Turner the artist, the poet in
paint, and I recalled what his great contemporary, Constable, had
said of him: that one of Turner's early pictures, 'a canal with
numerous boats making thousands of beautiful shapes,' was 'the
most complete work of genius' he had ever seen; that 'Turner's
light, whether it emanates from sun or moon, is exquisite'; that
'he seems to paint with tinted steam, so evanescent and so airy';
and then I repeated the passage about the golden visions glorious
and beautiful, only visions, but pictures to live and die with.</p>

<p>So I mused, turning from that sad little house, now so cheerful,
to gaze upon the Thames beloved by Turner. He was born near
the river; he chose his rural retreats at Hammersmith and Twickenham
because they were by the banks; and Wapping was the scene
of his later jaunts. Almost his first oil picture, 'Moonlight at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Millbank,' was painted by the riverside; one of his earliest drawings
was 'The Archbishop's Palace at Lambeth.' I rarely pass the
wharves south of the Houses of Parliament without seeing him,
as in a vision, squatting on his heels, and gazing for half an hour
at a time at the ripples. The magnificent new home of his
pictures is by the Thames at Millbank, and his last journey but
one was from the Thames: his last journey was to the crypt
of St. Paul's on the hill above the river: there he was rendered
to the mould:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Under the cross of gold<br />
That shines over city and river,<br />
There he shall rest for ever<br />
Among the wise and the bold.'<br />
</p>

<p>There, in the crypt, he was buried as he desired, by the side of
Sir Joshua Reynolds, and his funeral, as he desired and stipulated
in his will, cost one thousand pounds.</p>

<p>When I returned home from musing before the Turner Cottage,
I re-read the story of the last years of his life, how his hiding-place
was discovered, and so on to the end, and after. The true facts
were revealed through the pertinacity of John Pye the engraver,
who 'left certain memoranda of events connected with "Admiral
Booth's" tenancy of the Cremorne Cottage, and death under its
roof, which are of extraordinary interest.' Pye's memoranda were
summarised by Sir Walter Armstrong in his volume on Turner,
partly from a copy made by the late Sir Frederic Burton, and partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
from information supplied to Sir Walter by Mr. J. L. Roget, through
whose hands the whole of Pye's manuscripts passed.</p>

<p>But first a few words of connecting events before Turner's
hiding-place was discovered. His last appearance in public seems
to have been at the private view of the Royal Academy in 1851:
'he was shaky; he was feeble; he was no longer the sturdy,
dogged, strange being.' After that appearance, as he had ceased
to attend the council meetings, David Roberts wrote saying how
sorry his brother painters were not to see him, trusting that if he
were ill, they would be allowed to visit him, and promising, that if
he desired it, the secret of his dwelling-place should not be disclosed.
Turner made no answer to the letter, but two weeks later
he visited Roberts's studio in Fitzroy Square looking 'sadly broken
and ailing.' Turner was much affected by the letter he had received,
and said to Roberts: 'You must not ask me; but whenever
I come to town I will always come to see you.' 'I tried to
cheer him up,' says Roberts, 'but he laid his hand upon his heart
and replied, "No, no! There is something here which is all
wrong." Roberts noticed that his small eyes were as brilliant as
those of a child, eyes which some called grey and some blue.
Probably they were grey-blue.</p>

<p>The discovery of his hiding-place was made by Hannah Danby.
Turning over his clothes one day, she found a letter which gave
her the clue. In company with another old woman as old as
herself, she went to Chelsea, and in a shop obtained information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
that satisfied her as to the identity of 'Mr. Booth.' She informed
Mr. Harpur, one of Turner's executors, who hastened to Chelsea,
'only in time to find Turner sinking.' Dr. Price of Margate, an
old acquaintanee, was, besides Mrs. Booth, probably the only
other person who shared the secret of his seclusion. When Turner
sent for Dr. Price in the last weeks of 1851, he was told that death
was near. 'Go downstairs,' he said to the doctor, 'take a glass
of sherry and then look at me again.' The doctor did so, but the
reply was the same.</p>

<p>Just before his death Mrs. Booth wheeled him to the window
to look upon the winter sunset. He died in her arms, old Turner,
old woman, his head upon her shoulder, on the 19th of December
1851. So passed the greatest of all landscape painters, weary of
men and of orthodox ways, an old man tired of the fret of life,
but not tired of nature, an enthusiast to the end in his study
of light and its brother colour, and all phenomena, that which
is plain to the eyes, and that which hides. Sentiment was in
heyday in 1851, and so David Bogue, who made the picture of
the 'house where Turner died, sent a ray of sunlight streaming
down to the Chelsea room by the river, as if a parent were smiling
on a loving and life-loyal child.</p>

<p>The month following Turner's death, pertinacious Pye, as we
read in Sir Walter Armstrong's summary of his narrative,
had an interview with the owner of the Cremorne Cottage,
and was informed that some four or five years before a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and gentleman proposed to rent the cottage, but as they
declined to give names and references, it was arranged that
the rent should be paid in advance, and 'the unknown gentleman
and lady became installed in the quiet retreat of their choice.'
Some time later John Pye paid a second visit to Chelsea, and
talked with Mrs. Booth. She appeared, he says, to be about fifty,
was 'good-looking, dark, and kindly-mannered, but obviously
illiterate.' She told Pye that Turner always called her 'old 'un,'
and that she called him 'dear,' and that she first made his acquaintance
when he became her lodger near the Custom House at Margate.
She had known him for more than twenty years, the last five of
which had been spent in the Cremorne Cottage. Did any fires
of jealousy break into flame in the bosoms of these two women,
his housekeeper mistresses, Mrs. Booth and Hannah Danby, who
knew Turner so well, and who met by his deathbed?</p>

<p>The following extracts are from an account of the appearance
of Turner's house after his death, given to Thornbury by his 'kind
friend Mr. Trimmer':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Backwards stretched a large unfurnished room filled
with unfinished pictures; then a larger and drearier room
yet; lastly, a back room, against the walls of which stood
his unfinished productions, large full-length canvases
placed carelessly against the wall, the damp of which had
taken off the colours altogether, or had damaged them....
Then we went into Turner's sleeping apartment; it is surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
how a person of his means could have lived in such
a room; certainly he prized modern luxuries at a very
modest rate. I reserved his studio as the finale. Often had
I seen him emerge from that hidden recess when shown into
his gallery. That august retreat was now thrown open;
I entered. On a circular table lay his gloves and neck-handkerchief.
In the centre of the table was a raised box
with a circle in the centre with side compartments; a good
contrivance for an artist, though I had never seen one of
the kind before. In the centre were his colours, the great
object of my attraction. I remember, on my father's once
observing to Turner that nothing was to be done without
ultramarine, his saying that cobalt was good enough for
him; and cobalt, to be sure, there was, but also several
bottles of ultramarine of various depths; and smalts of
various intensities, of which I think he made great use....
Grinding colours on a slab was not his practice, and his dry
colours were rubbed on the palette with cold-drawn oil.
His colours were mixed daily, and he was very particular.
If not to his mind, he would say to Mrs. Danby, "Can't
you set a palette better than this?" Like Wilson, Turner
used gamboge: this was simply pounded and mixed with
linseed cold-drawn oil.</p>

<p>'His brushes were of the humblest description, mostly
large round hog's tools and some flat.... Mrs. Danby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
told me that when he had nearly finished a picture, he took
it to the end of his long gallery, and put in the last touches.
... I next inspected his travelling-box. Had I been
asked to guess his travelling library, I should have said
Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i> and Izaac Walton; and there they
were, together with some inferior translation of Horace....'</p>

<p>'His painting-room had no skylight. It had been
originally the drawing-room, and had a good north light,
with two windows.... There was a small deal box on a side
table; my father raised the lid to show me its contents;
it was covered with a glass, and under it was the cast of
the great Turner. Dear old Turner, there he lay, his eyes
sunk, his lips fallen in. He reminded me strongly of his
old father, whom long years before I had seen trudging to
Brentford market from Sandycombe Lodge, to lay in his
weekly supplies.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Times</i> in the account of Turner's funeral said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Even those who could only sneer and smile at the
erratic blaze of his colour, shifting and flickering as the light
of the Aurora, lingered minute after minute before the last
incomprehensible "Turner" that gleamed on the walls of
the Academy, and the first name sought for upon the
catalogue by the critic, artist, and amateur, as well as by
those who could not understand him when they found
him, was his also. Many of the most distinguished of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
painters, and many private friends, paid the last tribute
of respect to his remains, and followed his hearse yesterday,
and a long procession of mourning coaches and private
carriages, preceded it to the cathedral.... The coffin bore
the simple inscription: "Joseph Mallord Turner, Esq.,
R.A., died December 19th, 1851, aged 79 years."'
As the date of Turner's birth was not given by the <i>Times</i>, it
was probably unknown at the time. The date was 1775, and
therefore he was seventy-six when he died, not seventy-nine.</p></blockquote>

<p>The little, enlarged house in Cheyne Walk is not, like the Carlyle
house in Cheyne Row, a place of pilgrimage. His shrine is the
new Turner Gallery at Millbank. Ten years ago this 'new Turner
Wing' of the National Gallery of British Art was a dream: to-day
it is a reality. Perhaps, who knows, in ten years' time, on the site
of Turner's cottage by the Thames, extending on either side, there
may rise that home for 'the maintenance and support of Poor and
Decayed Male Artists being born in England and of English parents
only and lawful issue,' which he desired, which was explicit in his
will, and which we, his countrymen, the heirs of his achievement,
have entirely ignored.</p>

<h4>VICISSITUDES OF THE TURNER BEQUEST</h4>


<p>'In the name of God, Amen. I, Joseph Mallord William Turner,
R.A., of Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, in the County of
Middlesex, Esquire, do make and publish and declare this to be,
and contain my last Will and Testament....</p>

<p>Turner's long will, with the complicated codicils which he
added to it, fills eleven closely printed pages of an Appendix
to Thornbury's <i>Life.</i> It is a confused and involved document,
and the lawyers spent years and much money endeavouring to
effect a compromise between the contesting parties. Ruskin
succinctly summed up the litigation thus: 'The nation buried
with three-fold honour, Turner's body in St. Paul's, his pictures
at Charing Cross, and his purposes in Chancery.'</p>

<p>If love governed the world, if we lived for one another, it would
have been quite possible to carry out, at once, Turner's wishes,
which are sufficiently plain, in spite of the muddle of the will.
He desired that the nation should have his pictures, that they
should be kept together in a room or rooms added to the National
Gallery to be called 'Turner's Gallery,' to be built within a period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of ten years; that his fortune should be devoted to founding a
Charitable Institution for unfortunate artists; that provision
should be made for Hannah Danby and Mrs. Booth; that the
Royal Academy should be given funds to found a Turner Medal,
and that the testator should have a fitting monument in St. Paul's
and a fine funeral. Turner had revoked his legacies to his next
of kin: they were to have nothing. As Monkhouse justly remarks,
the will was not exactly an unselfish document. Apart from his
generosity to unfortunate brothers of the brush, and his care, no
more than his duty, for his mistress housekeepers, it was devised
to perpetuate his own fame, and to disregard his relatives.</p>

<p>In 1856 the Vice-Chancellor made an order which took the
place of the will. The nation obtained all the works of art by his
own hand, and the Royal Academy a sum of twenty thousand
pounds for the Turner Medal and Scholarship. The real estate
went to the heir-at-law, and Hannah Danby and Mrs. Booth received
their portions. The plates, engravings and copyrights,
and the rest of the property, were divided among the next-of-kin.</p>

<p>In 1854 the removal of the pictures and drawings from Queen
Anne Street to the National Gallery began; in 1856 a final
delivery was made, and in 1858 the catalogue delivered by the
assessors, Sir Charles Eastlake, the President of the Royal
Academy, and Mr. Knight, the secretary, consisted of the following
works:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>
Finished pictures<span style="margin-left: 50%;">100</span><br />
Unfinished pictures including<br />
mere beginnings<span style="margin-left: 51%;">182</span><br />
Drawings and sketches in<br />
colour and in pencil including<br />
about 300 coloured<br />
drawings<span style="margin-left: 56%;">19,049</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 66%;">19,331</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of the oil-paintings thirty-four were almost immediately placed
on exhibition. Additions were constantly made, until by May
1857, the exhibited works had reached the number of one hundred
and five. That, in brief, is the early history of the exhibited portion
of the Turner Bequest, as given in the preface to the <i>Inventory.</i>
The whole history, including the exhibition of a number of the
water-colours at Marlborough House and the Victoria and Albert
Museum, would require a long chapter to tell in detail.</p>

<p>I must now turn to the 19,049 drawings and sketches with
which the name of Ruskin is for ever associated. He has told
the story in his inimitable way in the preface to the fifth volume
of <i>Modern Painters.</i> In 1857 he received notice that permission
had been obtained for him from the Trustees of the National Gallery
to arrange, as he thought best, the Turner drawings belonging
to the nation. 'On which,' says Ruskin, 'I returned to London
immediately.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In seven tin boxes in the lower room of the National
Gallery, I found upwards of nineteen thousand pieces of
paper, drawn upon by Turner in one way or another. Many
on both sides; some with four, five or six subjects on each
side (the pencil point digging spiritedly through from the foregrounds
of the front into the tender pieces of sky on the back);
some in chalk, which the touch of the finger would sweep
away. (The best book of studies for his great shipwrecks
contained about a quarter of a pound of chalk debris, black
and white, broken off the crayons with which Turner had
drawn furiously on both sides of the leaves; every leaf,
with peculiar foresight, and consideration of the difficulties
to be met by future mounters containing half of one subject
on the front of it, and half of another on the back.) Others
in ink, rotted into holes; others (some splendid coloured
drawings among them) long eaten away by damp and
mildew, and falling into dust at the edges, in capes and
bays of fragile decay; others worm-eaten, some mouse-eaten,
many torn half-way through; numbers doubled
(quadrupled, I should say) up into four, being Turner's
favourite mode of packing for travelling; nearly all rudely
flattened out from the bundles in which Turner had finally
rolled them up, and squeezed them into his drawers in Queen
Anne Street. Dust of thirty years' accumulation, black,
dense and sooty, lay in the rents of the crushed and crumpled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
edges of these flattened bundles, looking like a jagged black
frame, and producing altogether unexpected effects in
brilliant portions of skies, whence an accidental or experimental
finger-mark of the first bundle-unfolder had swept
it away.... With two assistants, I was at work all the
autumn and winter of 1857, every day, all day long, and
often far into the night.</p>

<p>'The manual labour would not have hurt me; but the
excitement involved in seeing unfolded the whole career of
Turner's mind during his life, joined with much sorrow at
the state in which nearly all his most precious work had
been left, and with great anxiety, and heavy sense of
responsibility besides, were very trying; and I have
never in my life felt so much exhausted as when I
locked the last box, and gave the keys to Mr. Wornum
in May 1858.'</p></blockquote>

<p>It would take too long to continue the narrative of Ruskin's
labours: the four hundred cabinets designed by him to contain
the drawings; his privately printed catalogue; the official catalogue;
his division, interesting but bewildering, of the Exhibited
water-colours into groups; his notes upon them, delightful to the
dilettante, but of little service to the student.</p>

<p>The Unexhibited drawings were arranged by Ruskin in three
hundred and eight parcels, and classified by him according to
his theory of their artistic value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">71 parcels were inscribed with the letter 'R,' meaning, right</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">in intention.</span><br />
<br />
124 parcels were inscribed with the letter 'M,' meaning, middling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">value.</span><br />
<br />
108 parcels were inscribed with the letter 'O,' meaning, entire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">rubbish.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">5 were marked as unexamined.</span><br />
</p>


<p>Never was man less suited to the task of cataloguing, which
should be absolutely methodical and entirely unfanciful, than
John Ruskin. In a letter to the Keeper (Mr. R. N. Wornum),
enclosing his catalogue, Mr. Ruskin referred to the lettering on
the parcels as horrible, and added, 'I never meant it to be
permanent.'</p>

<p>For long it seemed as if the neglect of the tin boxes, containing
the parcels of unexhibited drawings, would be permanent. Mildew
formed on them, 'the contents of the tin boxes were in a dirty
state, with broken pieces of old sealing-wax, tattered fragments
of string, dusty brown paper, etc., etc.' In 1862 Ruskin, with the
assistance of Mr. George Allen, effected a kind of spring cleaning.
'I've got the mildew off,' he wrote, 'as well as I could, and henceforth
I've done with the whole business; and have told them they
must take it off themselves next time or leave it on&mdash;if they like.'
When Mr. E. T. Cook, who, in his book on the <i>Turner Drawings</i>,
did so much to arouse public interest in the 'buried Turners,' saw
the tin boxes in 1904, the 'mildew was on.' But the period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
neglect of the unexhibited portion of the Turner Bequest was nearly
at an end.</p>

<p>In 1905 Mr. A. J. Finberg was invited by the Trustees of the
National Gallery to classify the '19,049 pieces of paper' chronologically,
to re-arrange the Sketch-Books in order, and to compile
a chronological and descriptive <i>Inventory</i> of all the unexhibited
Turner sketches. Later it was decided to include the whole
collection of exhibited drawings and sketches. The work occupied
Mr. Finberg's entire time for four years, and the result was made
public in 1909, when a <i>Complete Inventory of the Drawings of the
Turner Bequest</i> was published as described in Chapter IV. The
exhibited water-colours, as well as all the sketches, are included in
the <i>Inventory.</i> Perhaps for the sake of accuracy, it would
have been better if Ruskin had never touched the seven tin
boxes. In following the communings of Turner with nature,
he disintegrated many of the Sketch-Books (over 150 were dismembered),
removed a leaf here and there, omitted to number them,
gave the sketches Ruskinian titles, and made the task of re-arranging
them in chronological or topographical order almost impossible.
Mr. Finberg allows himself the following gentle and amusing reproof
of his great predecessor: 'The question of dates had little
or no interest for Mr. Ruskin; on such questions he is, as M. Cherfils
grimly remarks, "<i>plus que sobre.</i>"'</p>

<p>In 1878, when a selection of nearly three hundred drawings
and sketches were exhibited on the ground floor of the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
wing of the National Gallery, the Turner water-colour rooms
became a place of pilgrimage; still more so when additional rooms
were added, and the sepia drawings for the <i>Liber</i> were displayed.
The collection was changed quarterly, and for years many made
a point of visiting those little rooms each time that the change was
made. Who did not love the 'delight drawings'? who did not
wonder anew each visit at their beauty? Students copied and
re-copied them, desiring nothing better in life than to sit there,
through long days, trying to follow the Master's vision.</p>

<p>So the years passed. Turner was a classic; his environment
was fixed. It seemed as if no alteration would ever be made in the
crowded gallery where his oil pictures hung, overflowing into the
adjoining room, or in the series of little rooms on the ground floor
which we visited at each re-hanging, greeting the water-colours at
each encounter like the faces, loved and lost awhile, of old friends.
It was enough to know when we missed them, that they would return
again, and that the 'buried Turners,' the Sketch-Books with their
thousands of pages, each containing something of the Master's
work, were being cared for. Turner was firmly settled in his
niche in the Temple of Fame. It seemed that nothing more could
ever happen to him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, in the month of May 1906, something did
happen: something that made the art sensation of the year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">That event was the exhibition of the 'unfinished' oils by
Turner at the Tate Gallery.</p>

<h4>1906: EXHIBITION OF THE 'UNFINISHED' TURNERS AT THE
TATE GALLERY</h4>


<blockquote>

<p>The event was heralded by the following paragraph communicated
to the Press by the Director and Trustees of the National Gallery:&mdash;
'Unexhibited Oil Paintings; Turner's Bequest. The
Turner Collection of paintings, placed in the custody of the
National Gallery Trustees, on September 25th, 1856, contained,
besides the pictures since hung in Public Exhibition
Rooms, or in the Official Rooms at Trafalgar Square, or
lent under the Loan Act of 1883 to Provincial Museums,
a certain number of paintings which, on account of their
unfinished or wrecked condition, it has never been thought
possible to exhibit.</p>

<p>'A more careful examination has lately led the Trustees
to believe that some, at least, of these paintings may now
be framed and take their place in the general collection.
A selection has been made for this purpose, and of the
paintings selected, many have been relined, and all are in
course of being surface cleaned and varnished.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>On February 5th, 1906, the 'unfinished' oil-paintings by
Turner were exhibited for the first time, in Room VII. of the Tate
Gallery. Those who were present will never forget the occasion.
Exclamations of delight and astonishment were continuous. Few
had ever experienced such a succession of thrills. Everybody was
surprised into&mdash;almost into extravagance. The <i>Times</i> began its
article: 'To-day the nation is invited to view some marvellous
treasures, of which it has all unconsciously been the possessor
for fifty years,' and quoted the remark of an artist who was present:
'We have never seen Turner before.' Another critic wrote: 'The
first <i>coup d'œil</i> of the room in which these treasures are displayed,
is one never to be forgotten for those with eyes for seeing. The
rare moment in life has come when criticism is disarmed. Suddenly,
and without warning, the observer has been transported
to the realms of enchantment.'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">It was, perhaps, unfortunate that mingled with these 'unfinished'
Turners, these prismatic and pearly visions, these flushes
of iridescent colour on white grounds, were some of the laboured
but magnificent failures of his later years and other periods. Those
who did not know the work of Turner thoroughly had some
difficulty in harmonising the brilliant impulses of his maturity
with the ambitious works of his decline.</p>

<p>For weeks the appearance of Room VII. at the Tate Gallery
had the aspect of a Private View day at the Royal Academy.
Really it seemed as if art had become popular. The shell of Anglo-Saxon
reserve was broken, and comments of amazement and delight
were uttered aloud at the shimmering light of the sunrise
series; at the pale beauty of the yachting pictures; at the loveliness
of 'The Evening Star' nocturne; at the Monticellian orgy
of colour in the 'Interior at Petworth'; at those irresistible final
efforts of his imagination, coherent if extravagant, the 'Sunrise
with a Sea Monster,' and 'The Burning of the Ships.'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Unfinished? A work of art is finished when the artist has
said all he has to say. Turner had no more to tell about sunrises,
sunsets, or pale sails against pale skies. He knew that, and he
had the strength to leave them as they are&mdash;unfinished, but
supremely realised.</p>

<h4>1908: FIFTY-TWO MORE 'UNEXHIBITED' TURNERS SHOWN AT
THE NATIONAL GALLERY</h4>


<p>In July 1908, it was announced that the Director of the National
Gallery had 'discovered' in the private offices, three large water-colours
by Turner. Later in the year, in the month of December,
these, with forty-nine other examples that had never been exhibited
before, were 'cleaned, mounted, framed,' and hung temporarily
in Room XXII. of the National Gallery. This series, although
extremely interesting, was not of the importance of the 1906 display.
Some of the water-colours and pencil drawings, it is said, were
found in a portfolio at the back of a bookcase, and the twelve oil
studies in a dusty parcel bearing Ruskin's initials. Those oil
studies, as has already been explained, were painted between
1805 and 1810 in oil on thin veneer; the forty water-colours were
painted round about the year 1800, and included several of large
size, such as 'Derwentwater,' 'Study for a Picture of Norham
Castle,' and 'Scarborough Castle' These 'new' Turners remained
for some time on screens in Room XXII. of the National
Gallery, drawing crowds of people eager to see so many of the
'delight drawings' and studies by Turner, some of them 'prentice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
work; some of the highest importance, but done before he had
quite mastered his material; some flashes of genius.</p>

<p>In 1910 they were removed to their last home in the Turner
Gallery at Millbank, and in that year six more were added to the
series&mdash;'St. Catherine's Hill, Guildford,' 2676; 'Newark Abbey,'
2677; 'Windsor from Lower Hope,' 2678; 'The Ford,' 2679;
'Sketch for Walton Bridges,' 2680; 'Walton Reach,' 2681.
Here are the titles of the twelve oil sketches, and the forty
water-colours. The Arabic numerals are those of the Catalogue,
the Roman numerals and letters against the water-colours

<p>The Turnerian surprises were not yet finished. They culminated
in the announcement that one of the desires expressed
by the painter in his will, namely, that his pictures should be kept
together in a building to be called the 'Turner Gallery,' was at
last about to be fulfilled through the generosity of Mr. J. J. Duveen,
afterwards Sir Joseph Duveen, who offered to add a new wing,
comprising five rooms, with other rooms below, to the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Gallery of British Art, for the exhibition of the Turner Bequest.
It was stated that the whole of the Turner collection would be
removed to this building, with the exception of such pictures as
should be needed sufficiently to exemplify the Master in the representative
British School at Trafalgar Square, including the two
works which, in fulfilment of the terms of his will, hang side by
side with two pictures by Claude Lorrain.</p>

<p>So at last the dream which many of us had been dreaming
for years, and working for in writing and speech, was to be realised.
It first became, I think, a subject of public interest through a letter
that Mr. Lionel Cust wrote to the editor of the <i>Times</i> in July 1906,
at a time when the Government authorities contemplated utilising
the vacant land at the back of the Tate Gallery for a new Stationery
Office. The support given to Mr. Cust's proposals caused the abandonment
of this scheme, and the Director of the National Gallery
was informed by the First Commissioner of Works that if a certain
sum of money could be provided from private sources to erect a
Turner Gallery, the Government would be prepared to find the
remainder. Thanks to the efforts of Sir Hugh Gilzean Reid, this
sum was within a near distance of being secured, when further
need for it was removed by the generous action of Mr. Duveen,
who offered to erect a Turner Gallery at his own cost.</p>

<p>In 1907 the nation became indebted to Mr. C. Mallord Turner
for a number of Turner relics. This collection, lent for a period
of ten years, includes two cases of models of ships and a cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
of glass jars of colour from the artist's house; an oil-colour box
with palette and brushes; a travelling pocket-book holding cakes
of water-colour; several drawings, and a letter from Turner to his
father; the catalogue of pictures and drawings on exhibition at his
gallery in 1809; one of the original copper plates for the <i>Liber
Studiorum</i>, etched and mezzotinted by himself; eight volumes
from his library, including guide and handbooks, with annotations
and sketches by Turner; and a volume of MS. poems, and specimen
MSS. of the lectures given by him at the Royal Academy as
Professor of Perspective. Another donation, from Mr. Sidney
Cockerell, was a portrait of Turner by Charles Turner, with an
inscription on the back, stating that the drawing was made about
two months before the death of the sitter, in 1851. It is a profile
to right, head and shoulders, and the official description of the
garments he wears is&mdash;'tall hat, white collar, large tie with pin
and top-coat.'</p>

<p>In the months of May and June, 1910, the Turner Room at the
National Gallery, the well-known, well-loved room was dismantled,
and in June, the Turner Room at the Tate Gallery was closed, and
the 'unfinished' oils were carried through the doorway of the new
Turner wing, now ready for hanging. A screen was placed before
the entrance, but the visitor looking above the screen had a glimpse
of the brilliant red wall-hangings, and he wondered, somewhat
anxiously, how the old dark Turners would look in their new and
gorgeous environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The very early pictures have not been admitted to the splendour.
They hang outside the annexe, on the dividing wall separating
Room V. from the Turner Gallery, four on one side of the doorway,
four on the other, examples of the Turner who had not begun to
find his way. Some of the titles suggest light and air, but the
execution is heavy and fumbling, and they are blackened by time.
At the extreme left is the little 'Carnarvon Castle' of the year
1800; above is a trifle called 'View of a Town,' of 1798. In the
middle of the group is the huge 'Morning on the Coniston Fells,
Lancashire,' exhibited in 1798, muddled, inconsequent, almost a
libel on the fines from <i>Paradise Lost</i> that accompanied it&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
'Ye mists and exhalations that now arise,<br />
From hill or streaming lake, dusky or grey,<br />
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,<br />
In honour to the world's great Author rise.'<br />
</p>

<p>Adjoining this blackened 'Morning' is an unimportant, hardly
noticeable 'Sea Piece,' painted about 1802.</p>

<p>On the other side of the doorway is the 'Moonlight, a Study at
Millbank,' of 1797, looking like a fog at midnight dominated by a
moon&mdash;like a wafer. Adjoining it is the pleasant self-portrait,
painted in 1802 when he was twenty-seven&mdash;Turner with the strong
chin, loose lower lip and the observant eyes, gazing straight out
at the world. Next to it is the 'Mountain Scene' of 1800, small
and poor, and beneath is the straightly-seen 'View on Clapham
Common,' quite attractive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost pathetic is this wall of timid and indifferent early
Turners, hanging just without the precincts of the superb array
of his life work, but interesting as showing from what insignificant
beginnings rose the mighty edifice. I think if I had my way, I
would make the contrast even more marked, almost epigrammatic.
I would hang the little 'Moonlight at Millbank' just above the
'Sunrise With a Boat Between Headlands,' and the little 'Carnarvon
Castle' against the loveliness of 'Norham Castle' at dawn.</p>

<p>Again and again I visited this threshold room, barred by a
screen from the new Turner Gallery. At ten o'clock on the morning
of July 18th, 1910, I was there again with an invitation-card to
view the 'New Turner Wing.'</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LIX" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX</a></h5>


<h4>1910: THE NEW 'TURNER GALLERY' AT MILLBANK</h4>


<p>So, at last, fifty-nine years after his death one of the wishes of his
muddled will is almost obeyed&mdash;that his works should be hung 'in
a room or rooms, to be added to the National Gallery, and to
be called "Turner's Gallery."'</p>

<p>It would have been better if the new Turner Gallery had adjoined
the National Gallery; but that seems to have been impossible.
At present the exhibited portion is distributed thus:
129 oils and 467 water-colours, etc., at the Tate Gallery; 20 oils
and a large selection of water-colours at the National Gallery; and
31 oils and other works in the provinces. The Salting Bequest
water-colours are in the British Museum, and there are also
many examples, varying from his first to his last period, at the
Victoria and Albert Museum, with several oil pictures. Besides
these there is the unexhibited portion of the Bequest, and the
numerous oil pictures and water-colours in private and public
collections in this country and abroad, making the largest amount
of work ever produced single-handed by any artist.</p>

<p>There is one word only to describe the setting of the new Turner
Gallery, the word magnificent. There are five rooms on the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
floor, and four on the ground floor. The walls of the two large
rooms or halls are covered with a rich Venetian red silk brocade,
the walls of the others are hung with gold canvas.</p>

<p>The first new Turner Room is 34 yards long, nearly 11 yards
wide, and 13 yards high. I hardly knew the old, familiar masterpieces.
At first I saw nothing but that gorgeous red brocade,
sweeping over the walls, probably the colour Turner himself used
(but certainly in a cheaper material) in his own gallery in Queen
Anne Street. Red may have been his favourite colour, but we must
remember that in his Queen Anne Street Gallery, the walls were
covered with pictures, so that the red hangings were barely visible.</p>

<p>In the new Turner Gallery the eyes see first the dominating red
walls,&mdash;then the pictures. No work is skied. All the pictures are
on the line, arranged chronologically, from the dark 'Tenth Plague
of Egypt' of 1802, to the flaming 'Fire at Sea' of 1834. How well,
sombre but glowing, they all look. Hanging together are those
early, grandiose, masterful canvases, a challenge to the art world
of his day, the 'Calais Pier,' the 'Nelson,' and 'The Shipwreck.'
Opposite, on the line for the first time, is the vast 'England:
Richmond Hill,' vastly entertaining.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">At one end of the room hangs the well-loved, cool, and temperate
'Crossing the Brook,' and at the other end, facing it, that mighty
effort of his imagination, 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus,' almost
dwarfed, strange to say, by its companions the whirling 'Medea,'
and the flaming 'Fire at Sea.' Here and there are the quieter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
works, pastoral and appealing, done in 1809, when his mind was
happy and at rest, the 'Bligh Sand,' and the 'River Scene with
Cattle,' so tranquilly aglow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">Plate XLVII. <span class="smcap">The Burning of the Ships</span> (1840 <i>or after</i>) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The next room is hung with the best of the 'unfinished' oils.
The red silk brocade is almost too overpowering for the aerial
loveliness of the 'Sunrise' pictures, for that magical' Hastings,' with
the tawny sail, and the crepuscular delicacy of 'The Evening Star.'
The pearly 'Yachting' series stands the ordeal better, and that
glorious riot of colour, 'Interior at Petworth,' actually flaunts the
red brocade. The old warrior pictures look better than ever&mdash;
'The Fighting Téméraire,' the 'Burial of Wilkie,' and that swift
foreshadowing of Impressionism, 'Rain, Steam and Speed.' If
Turner, mad for fame, as for art, could have seen these two rooms,
one hung with the pictures he did for exhibition, the other with
those he did for joy! If only he could have had prevision of this
year of his triumph!</p>

<p>The other seven rooms hung with gold canvas&mdash;just right&mdash;contain
a selection of his water-colours, finished and unfinished,
oil beginnings, and others. The water-colours range from the copy
of 'Folly Bridge,' which he made at the age of twelve, to such visions
of his later years, when definition became lost in light, and form
in colour, as 'Ravine and Tower,' and 'The Via Mala,' and certain
dreams from the 'Rheinfelden' and 'Heidelberg' Sketch-Books,
that one looks at with wonder and joy, and again with wonder
and joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a room of his early water-colours with two exquisite
interpretations of 'Norham Castle'; there is a room of the sepia
drawings for the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>, with a case in the middle
containing twenty-one supreme water-colours, dominated, at the
end of the case, by the 'Venetian Fishing Boat'&mdash;a fairy thing
flashing green, blue, and gold; and elsewhere there is a range of
his water-colours, each a treasure; but I think my choice would
fall upon 'Sunshine on the Sea,' everything omitted except&mdash;sunshine
upon the sea.</p>

<p>On the ground floor, approached by a staircase (on the stair
walls hang three of his colossal failures, 'Waterloo,' 'The Deluge,'
and 'Pilate'&mdash;do not look at them!&mdash;), are four more rooms. One
contains seventeen 'beginnings' of oil pictures, painted about
1807, never exhibited before in public, but probably shown in his
studio in Queen Anne Street in 1808, to tempt patrons to commission
'finished' pictures from them. Times have changed. We
value beginnings now. Another ground-floor room is hung with
large 'unfinished' early water-colours, including a lovely beginning
in a rosy flush, of 'Coniston Old Man,' and an atmospheric filmy
blue 'Valley with Mountains.'</p>

<p class="caption">Plate XLVIII. <span class="smcap">Venetian Fishing Boat. Water Colour</span> (1839) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>

<p>An adjoining room contains the oils on thin veneer, painted
between 1805 and 1810, and first exhibited in 1908. My choice
would be 'Tree Tops and Sky.' And the last room of all, a
light, cheerful apartment, as it should be, includes his last four
pictures, painted the year before he died, and other magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>failures and experiments. Here is a picture of the period when
he was haunted by the idea of Whalers in Arctic seas; and
when he muddled off a final beauty in despair of Venice at
sunset with a blue sky and ragged clouds; and when he tried
to see 'The Angel Standing in the Sun,' driving Death before
him, Turner then being seventy-one; and other dreams by this
amazing man, whose art vision endured, not only to the end,
but became more ethereal and dehumanised and seer-like as his
physical frame shrank and tottered.</p>

<p>All that is over. The immortal part of him remains, and this
is the year of his final triumph, long delayed. He who loved
fame and praise, and spent much of his life pitting himself
against his contemporaries and predecessors, would chuckle to
know that his works in the new Catalogue of the Tate Gallery
extend to 144 pages, while all the other artists represented have
but 264 pages between them.</p>

<p>It was almost a shock to return from these golden lower
rooms to the two large galleries on the main floor, adorned with
the rich red silk brocade, that dazzles and distresses. I cannot
like these red, flaming walls, but there is no doubt that the
pictures look finer than they did in Trafalgar Square. Indeed, we
seem to see some of them for the first time. I never realised before
what a stupendous work is the 'Snowstorm&mdash;Steamboat off a
Harbour's Mouth, Making Signals.' One could spend an hour
studying the swirl of the waves and the whirl of the storm, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
movement of those deep water waves, and the lights that gleam
in and through them. Incline your head a little to the right, and
there is 'A Ship Aground,' with the tugging movement of shallow
water, the reflections and the gleams portrayed with equal skill.
Then turn your eyes still further to the right, and there is 'Rain,
Steam, and Speed' and the 'Burial of Wilkie.' For some reason
or another&mdash;the red walls, or the wonderful lighting of the gallery,
or the flame of Turner that in this year of his triumph spiritualises
our perceptions&mdash;these pictures seem to have taken on more delicate
delicacies of eolour, new intricacies of vision.</p>

<p>And what about the 'Interior at Petworth,' that Mr. MacColl
has bravely hung in the place of honour in the gallery where 'The
Evening Star' and 'The Fighting Téméraire' dispute for our
allegiance? The 'Interior at Petworth' is a puzzle to almost
everybody. I watched a nice father and his nice little daughter,
who had been talkative before most of the Turners, stand in front
of this orgy of colour&mdash;dumb. Then the little girl said: 'Daddy,
what does it mean?' And he after a long pause and another long
look said, very seriously, as if he were a little ashamed: 'I don't
know what it means, my dear.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">Plate XLIX. <span class="smcap">A Ship Aground</span> (1830) Tate Gallery</p>
</div>


<p>How I longed to say to them: 'Friends, Turner didn't mean
you to know what his "Interior at Petworth" means. He
didn't mean you to see it. It's like this. He was a great
artist, almost miraculous, with extraordinary faculties and
power of work, and an ambition, that was almost a mania, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
excel all other painters, living and dead, and to make the public
of his day realise what a mighty man he was. So he painted his big
exhibition pictures, every inch finished, understandable by everybody,
classical, pastoral, homely, heroic&mdash;"The Bay of Baiæ,"
"Crossing the Brook," the "Frosty Morning," and "The Fighting
Téméraire"; but that was only half his life. He was mad about
drawing and painting; he never rested; he was always making
experiments, trying to capture the fleeting loveliness of dawn or
sunset, the pomp of high noon, and the splendour of colour in hot
sunshine that to some artists is as intoxicating as wine. He never
meant such experiments, done to relieve his surcharged soul, to
be seen; he never exhibited them. It is we, valuing every scrap
from Turner's hand, who are responsible for their exhibition; it is
we who have brought to the light of day these attempts of the
wizard, the old man mad about art, to force painting to realise
what others would have thought to be unrealisable. They are
wonderful. Folk will come from the end of the world to see them.</p>

<p>'Friends, how that room at Petworth came to be in that awful
disarray I know not. It looks like a nightmare spring-cleaning,
with no witness of the fury but the streaming sun. Turner looked
on the sight&mdash;that's certain; was intoxicated by the orgy of
colour, painted it in one swift hour, and having cased his soul, hid
his colour-cry, as men hide their love poems in youth.'</p>

<p>Thus would I have spoken to that nice father and nice child;
but while I was rehearsing my remarks, they had moved on. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
sought them, and found the twain in one of the lower rooms
where some of the early water-colours are displayed, 'unfinished,'
because they were painted for love, not for exhibition, and love
had said in them all that love can say.</p>

<p>I found the father and child standing just where I would like
them to have been&mdash;before those two exquisite drawings hanging
by the window, looking, not like paint, but like vapours of iridescent
colour&mdash;the rosy flush of 'Coniston Old Man,' and the filmy blue of
'Valley with Mountains.'</p>

<p>Father and child were silent, but there was something in their
eyes more eloquent than words. Then her hand stole into his and
was clutched tight. My eyes moistened too. For I was looking
upon the visible signs of invisible things. Love made those drawings,
and the watchers were quickened by their loveliness. The
father's grasp grew tighter on the small hand as she blinked away
the mist in her eyes.</p>

<p>I should like to have explained, to that nice father and child,
the Sketch-Books, the unseen part of Turner's prodigious achievement,
the studies direct from Nature for his own use, records as
he called them. Throughout his life his procedure seems to have
been always the same&mdash;the sketch or the mere note direct from
Nature, on which later, sometimes years later, he based an oil
picture, or a water-colour for the engravers.</p>

<p>He could always, when he had once 'wrenched himself free
from the trammels of topography and antiquarianism,' make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
vital sketch from Nature, but it took him years to master oil-painting.
The dark, heavy, early 'Buttermere Lake' was made
from 'a pale and delicately charming water-colour.' There is not
an artist who would not be delighted to study, in the Sketch-Books,
the slight vital suggestions and to compare them with the
finished works&mdash;the beginning and the end of his Hornby, Heysham,
Watchet, Boscastle, Bolton; to look at the vigorous studies from
which the 'Bridgewater Sea Piece,' and 'The Shipwreck' were
made, and to swoop down upon that astonishing foreshadowing
of Impressionism, 'Men Chatting Round the Fireplace at Petworth,'
made during the visit to Petworth when he was fifty-five, from
which his dream, world-well-lost period dated: Turner the visionary,
who, like Wordsworth at the end, passed into regions where feeling
is almost too mystical, too rarefied for expression, and indeed can
only be expressed by allusion and suggestion.</p>

<p>The Turner Sketch-Books are as valuable, in their way, as, say,
a discovery of diaries kept by Shakespeare from the day he first
left Stratford to the hour he returned home full of honours and
wisdom. Turner died in hiding&mdash;by choice; and, to our great
advantage, he hoarded his Sketch-Books, as he hoarded his 'unfinished'
works, meant only for his own eyes, those gleaming,
grey-blue eyes that never lost their sparkle, and that saw and controlled
his hand to paint a 'Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus' for
fame, and a 'Teasing the Donkey at Petworth' for joy.</p>

<h4>TURNER AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY&mdash;AND CLAUDE. A
LAST LOOK</h4>


<p>Turner has not disappeared from the National Gallery; he still
has a small shrine there. The oil pictures retained at the National
Gallery, with 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' in the place of honour,
show an aspect of his achievement, but not the progressive
splendour of his genius. In this room hang the two famous
works by Claude Lorrain. Every one knows the story, which
has been told again in these pages, how Turner, long before his
death, bequeathed 'The Sun Rising Through Vapour' and 'Dido
Building Carthage' to the nation on the condition that they
should hang for ever between two paintings by Claude. Turner
outshone Claude in all other fields, as the sun outshines the
moon, but he never conquered Claude in the particular classical
garden that the Lorrainer cultivated. You may judge for yourself.
There they hang, the two great Claudes, between the two
great Turners, an arrangement sanctioned by the Court of Chancery;
there, if the spirits of the departed do ever visit this earthly
scene of competition and aspiration, these two purified souls should
have a gallant and courteous encounter.</p>

<p>The twain would look gravely at the Turner pictures, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Turner would explain, if spirits need explanations, that the
supreme work of his life is not here. But there are some works
on the walls that would make Claude wonder.</p>

</div>


<p>Would he not look entranced at Turner's visions of Venice
&mdash;four pictures showing how he progressed from topographical
facts to impressions of the city fading in the sea, trailing the
loveliness of her colour with her: from the hard 'Bridge of
Sighs,' with the metallic blue sky, painted in 1833, to the magic
'San Benedetto' of ten years later, the golden sky flecked with
crimson, and the golden pathway on the sea, an open gate
leading to a land that exists only in the imagination of poets in
words and in paint.</p>

<p>Claude would look at this golden path that 'lies o'er the sea
invisible,' and at that other splendour, glorious still, though faded
like the real Venice, called 'The "Sun of Venice" Going to Sea,'
such a sea, such a fishing-boat sailing out from the rose-red city.</p>

<p>Claude would look, and his eyes would glisten, and he would
make obeisance, and acknowledge the supremacy of his companion
in these paintings of the loveliness and mystery of light and
colour.</p>

<p>With the other Turners at the National Gallery Claude would
feel on more equal ground, and while looking at 'Ancient Rome,'
with the diaphanous buildings, he might murmur the title of his
own 'Enchanted Castle,'&mdash;fantasy arising firmly from fact, not as
in 'Ancient Rome,' fantasy accompanied by uncouth facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>And Claude would realise the inequalities of 'The Meuse,
Orange-Merchantmen going to pieces on the Bar,' the incomparable
sky, and the grotesque and ill-drawn figures of the fishermen lolling
in their boats; the glory of 'Orvieto,' in the sky, and the unsubstantially
of the figures and the fountain in the foreground; the
force and swing of the sea in 'Spithead,' and the impossible height
of the waves; the loveliness and splendour of the panorama of
nature in 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,' and the futility of the
'party of pleasure' in the foreground; and&mdash;and&mdash;the tumbling
splendour of 'Queen Mab's Grotto,' done when the old man was
seventy-one, still ambitious, still ready at a moment's notice to
realise the unrealisable.</p>

<p>Turner must explain to Claude, as henceforth officials must
explain to bewildered visitors, that the works at the National
Gallery are but a small part, not very representative, of his
colossal life-work; that to see his achievement in all its astonishing
variety, it is necessary to descend to the ground floor of the
National Gallery, where a selection of the water-colours is still
shown, and where the Sketch-Books are preserved, and then to
make the journey to Millbank, home of the magnificence of Turner
from the sombre masterpieces of his youth to the golden visions
of his maturity&mdash;from his early experiments in tinted drawings to
his last flashes of colour lost in light&mdash;works that have made the
child who was born in a dark London court of a crazy mother
and a chirpy father&mdash;immortal.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
